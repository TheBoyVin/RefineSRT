1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,413
- All right.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,530
So, hello again.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,790
Please just tell me in your name,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,490
just some basic things

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,430
about choosing a man* years at TCNJ.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,770
How you came to teach,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,100
how do to counter like WGSS* department.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,980
And when you came TCNJ,

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,240
your departmental affiliation or did you teach? Okay?

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,600
- So hi, my name is Cecilia Colbeck

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,130
and I have been employed

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,760
at the College of New Jersey since 2007.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,130
I came to the College of New Jersey as a program coordinator

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,400
for the Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies department.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,550
So I didn't come in as an affiliate teaching,

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,120
I came in more through the administration way.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,760
So I'm not only affiliated with WGS,

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,070
I've also worked for the English department

19
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,849
for about six years and now for about seven or so,

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,310
I'm also affiliated with the pre-law program

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,070
and for the philosophy department.

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,990
So for all of these departments,

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,760
I do come in bringing an administrative background.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,124
But with WGS, I also have a grad certificate and gender

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,620
studies,

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,562
so now I also teach as an adjunct for the department as

27
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:33,570
well.

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,490
- Yes, that's so amazing.

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,210
And I already know you personally

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,914
for all the amazing things that you're so JSs* students

31
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:46,950
with.

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,120
So with that, do you have like a favorite class,

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,850
what are they and why?

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,803
- Okay, so I'm gonna expand before I get into my favorite

35
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:57,840
classes,

36
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,330
I'm thinking I'm going to talk about a little bit more of,

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,360
you know, some of my favorite administrative duties

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,380
within the department.

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,220
Yeah, my ability to be able to interact

40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,140
and form relationships with students.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,290
Because I get to know them when they come in,

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,810
either as freshmen or transfer students,

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,508
I'm probably the first email that they get from the

44
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:19,530
department.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,770
Or the first, you know, face to face meeting.

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,870
Because I see your transcripts,

47
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,850
I see your admissions paperwork and everything.

48
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,630
And so I reach out to you so that when you come

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,250
for accepted students day,

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,160
or you come for freshmen or transfer orientation day,

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,990
you know, I am there.

52
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,180
And I already have a plan for you

53
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,190
of what your major will look like

54
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,120
and what your four years here at TCNJ might look like.

55
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,230
And also able to tell you what beyond the academics

56
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,140
you should be taking part in, like student organizations.

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,750
We have Will*, do you want to be a part of Will*.

58
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,920
So, you know, I think the favorite part of my job

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,190
while I do enjoy teaching is I also get to spend

60
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,530
a lot more time with the students, I think.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,620
You know, outside of the classroom as well,

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,250
because I am also an advisor to like 16 organizations.

63
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,229
So Triaud*, women's center, PRISM, Ignite*.

64
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,540
And I get to know you in and out of the classroom.

65
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,910
And that is the best part of my job,

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,190
being able to interact with the students.

67
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,300
As for favorite classes, since I started teaching,

68
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,710
there are two that I particularly enjoy, and I enjoy.

69
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,490
It's a topics course and it's called gender, race,

70
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,520
and sexuality and sports because I enjoy sports.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,970
And in that course, I get a lot of non-majors.

72
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,720
So I'm able to expose them to a lot

73
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,780
of the Women's and Gender and Sexuality Studies.

74
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,900
You know, foundational, information of the discipline,

75
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,270
because they've probably never had it before.

76
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,760
So it opens their eyes, you know,

77
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,320
to how all aspects of our society

78
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,330
intersects with what we are teaching here in WGS.

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,700
And then my other favorite course

80
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,580
is a women's history course because I'm also a historian

81
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,190
and it is documented US Women's History

82
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,290
when I look at the US Women's Suffrage Movement.

83
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,120
How women in this country, you know, got the right to vote.

84
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,370
And again, this course is eye opening

85
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,100
to a lot of people because they don't realize that,

86
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,550
you know, when the colonies first came into existence,

87
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,710
women did have the right to vote

88
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,920
and that vote was taken away from them by men.

89
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,770
And then it was embedded, okay?

90
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,280
In the Constitution that women wouldn't have

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,290
the right to vote, just males.

92
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,770
Yeah, and so we have to go back and look,

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,180
why was that right to vote taken away from us?

94
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,000
And another reason I love this course is because,

95
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,110
you know, we dwell into how Native American societies

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,260
influence the Constitution and influence

97
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,480
those members of the Suffrage Movement

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,860
that we are more familiar with.

99
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,570
So say Elizabeth Cady Stanton*,

100
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,450
you know, or Susan B Anthony.

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,570
And how they were influenced by Native American women

102
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,820
and their roles in their societies.

103
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,150
And so a lot of this is just new information

104
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,770
and eye opening to students,

105
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,710
and I love being able to share that with them.

106
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,170
Or just have a knowledge on this process.

107
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,384
Yes.

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,040
That right to vote and how it's taken away

109
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,590
and when was that, no, I don't want that.

110
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,460
But I love the way like how you basically just turned it

111
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,480
into like, an expressive way ways to teach non-level

112
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,537
justic*e,

113
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,660
majors and minors.

114
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,720
And I think that's what's amazing.

115
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,090
With that, I know you've been,

116
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
you said that you've been like a part

117
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,330
of these different departments over the last few years.

118
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,930
So please tell me like, from your perspective,

119
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,940
how has the Department changed?

120
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,560
How has your job changed over the last few years?

121
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,680
- So how has the department changed?

122
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,480
I think that, you know,

123
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,200
we have become more intertwined

124
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,120
with other departments on campus.

125
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,270
So such as the African American Studies departments,

126
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,230
sociology, anthropology, you know, criminology,

127
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,200
because all of our and history, don't let me forget history,

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,920
because all of our courses are intersectional, all right?

129
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,946
And the disciplines, everything that we teach in WGS,

130
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,550
you know, is somehow also taught in these other courses.

131
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,200
So we're able to offer students the ability to double major,

132
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,620
which is something they may not have thought about before.

133
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,510
So when we are able to show them

134
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,540
that because all of our courses are so intersectional

135
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,000
with other disciplines that you can actually take,

136
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,670
you know, three courses from history

137
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,300
and cross list them with WGS and have a double major,

138
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,960
I love how that really makes the students eyes,

139
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,220
you know, sparkle and say,

140
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,278
"Oh, I can do that.

141
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,220
"I didn't know that I have the time to do that."

142
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,240
So just showing them how that is possible,

143
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,330
and why it's possible is very, very important

144
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,330
because of our courses being so interdisciplinary,

145
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,380
and how they intersect and giving them that opportunity.

146
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,400
So, you know, yet double majors who come on in,

147
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,380
like with communication studies,

148
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,630
not realizing they can do something like this,

149
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,610
or journalism, professional writing.

150
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,940
And it really opens up new areas

151
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,130
for these students for when they graduate

152
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,810
to branch out career-wise,

153
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,120
because they're bringing something additional.

154
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,060
- I'm speaking on this double major,

155
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,660
and I know you mentioned a lot of how students

156
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,050
have definitely then attract laughter within your job,

157
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,830
and you're at TCNJ, and the WGS department.

158
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,050
So how would you say the students

159
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,910
had changed over the years?

160
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,828
- Students are, you know, I think when the department

161
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:29,850
started,

162
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,620
and I wasn't here, when the department started,

163
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,780
or the number of majors was low.

164
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,930
It was, you know, not a new discipline, but new to TCNJ.

165
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,810
And our students and their parents, always,

166
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,970
you know, we're coming in and asking the questions,

167
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,440
what am I goa with this degree?

168
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,790
What am I gonna do with this degree,

169
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,420
not realizing I could do anything with this degree.

170
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,660
But I'm finding the students that are,

171
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,090
you know, accepted into TCNJ

172
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,270
and coming into WGS as a major as freshmen.

173
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,990
You know, coming in with more knowledge

174
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,560
about how important this discipline is than past majors.

175
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,050
So, you know, we may not have to,

176
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,620
you know, so much sell* them on the major,

177
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,380
because they're already to be majors.

178
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,440
So whether it be in high school or through their activism

179
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,960
that they're taking part in their local

180
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,780
or you know, State community,

181
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,390
they know, they wanna to be a part of this department

182
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,100
because they have found something

183
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,480
that they're passionate about.

184
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,730
And then coming to WGS.

185
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,860
Yeah, just simply builds upon that

186
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,930
and gives them more of the academic,

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,770
you know, requirements that they need.

188
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,210
But they're also able to put it into practice.

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,190
Yeah, no, I take that and,

190
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,020
you know, put that knowledge into action.

191
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,410
So the students I think are coming in more aware

192
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,560
and being able to explain to their parents

193
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,590
why this discipline is so important.

194
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,500
They're coming in with that foundational knowledge now.

195
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,350
And, you know, in my opinion,

196
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,810
we haven't had to be able to sell to the parents

197
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,640
as much as we had to before.

198
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,980
So I'm hoping that means that parents

199
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,430
are trusting their children's judgment in regards to,

200
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,750
you know, what they want to study

201
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,730
and what they believe they will be good at.

202
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,300
You know, once they have to be out there

203
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,610
looking for a career and what they want to do

204
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,810
as a citizen of this nation, and of this world, yes.

205
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,798
- Yeah, definitely, I think there has been a shift.

206
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,300
Now if my parents definitely allow their child

207
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,100
to do what they want with in college,

208
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,353
and especially when it comes to like the WGS major and

209
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:42,360
minor,

210
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,310
like, what is that and now like,

211
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,100
I think that people have definitely just given

212
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,530
a level of like, you can do anything*.

213
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,310
- Definitely, and I think because WGS

214
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,060
has always been a discipline that is focused on social

215
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,097
justice.

216
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,150
And now, social justice,

217
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,572
you know, within the last few years has become more

218
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:04,650
prominent.

219
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,132
It's more out there and I think that has to do with social

220
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,180
media.

221
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,700
It's always been around, but it hasn't been

222
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,850
that well publicized or talked about,

223
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,850
you know, not so much in your face, so now it is.

224
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,600
Social media has really given the opportunity

225
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,130
for people to speak about the injustices that they see.

226
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,220
And it's, you know, information now,

227
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,980
in this time and the technology that we're able to use,

228
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,320
it's out there instantly, all right?

229
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,030
And so people are out there,

230
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,070
they're taking part in these social movements,

231
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,020
they're taking part in these protests.

232
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,290
But a lot of the things that these movements

233
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,440
are based upon I think WGS has been talking about for a long

234
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,466
time.

235
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,160
- Yes. So, another question I'm gonna ask you is,

236
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,040
how has the other departments in C*hapter been historian

237
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,680
from working with the pre-law program

238
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,500
and then philosophy, things like that,

239
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,090
how have those other departments, basically,

240
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,420
impacted your work in the WGS department?

241
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,370
- So one thing with the philosophy department,

242
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,970
you know, and having to be work in conjunction with them

243
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,970
is that, you know, knowing some of the faculty,

244
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,260
such as Holly Hayes is one faculty member.

245
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,410
From working with her and talking to her,

246
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,640
she developed a core course called feminism and philosophy.

247
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,580
So it's a new course that philosophy majors can take,

248
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,150
but our WGS majors can take as well, all right?

249
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,104
So looking at that interdisciplinary, you know, opportunity,

250
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,140
she developed this new course.

251
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,350
Pre-law, it's the same thing.

252
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,990
I have some students within the pre law program

253
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,330
who are not sure what area of the law

254
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,560
they want to go into.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,630
So, they're looking more at law that,

256
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,880
you know, protects the rights of innocents.

257
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,120
Human rights laws, social justice law.

258
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,284
And again, that is so connected to what we do here in WGS.

259
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,770
So when I have an opportunity,

260
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,750
and I'm talking to philosophy students,

261
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,670
I'm talking to pre-law students.

262
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,770
And I especially did this when I was working

263
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,900
with the English department and I still do,

264
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,220
again, is I inform them about how they can use WGS

265
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,730
as a double major, all right?

266
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,700
To help them you know, build an academic portfolio

267
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,931
that will assist them when they go out for their future

268
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,940
careers.

269
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,770
Whether it be graduate school,

270
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,800
or whether it be law school, or whether it's out there,

271
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,750
just getting their job right when they're done,

272
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,370
you know, with their college career.

273
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,849
- Yes, so, I want to know, like,

274
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,530
how has the digests* Department changed,

275
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,680
you and all the years that you've been working here?

276
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,300
- All right, so I am the mother of four boys,

277
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,570
and I was the mother of four boys before I came to WGS

278
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,300
and I knew I was a feminist, all right?

279
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,350
I wanted my boys to also grow up to be feminists,

280
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,070
but working in the WGS department

281
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,067
has given me more of the, I guess,

282
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,360
the ability to, to talk to my children,

283
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,540
you know, and talk to students and be able

284
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,190
to give them some, you know, I guess, historical background

285
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,740
on what it means to be a feminist, all right?

286
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,950
What is misconstrued when you say feminism

287
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,410
and to, you know, educate them?

288
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,640
You know, so just working in this department,

289
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,560
I think it has also let me grow as an individual.

290
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,320
And also as an academic because as I said,

291
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,840
you know, I came to TCNJ

292
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,320
within an administrative position,

293
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,770
and already having an undergraduate and graduate degree.

294
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,920
But while I was here, because I work for TCNJ,

295
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,683
I was also able to get a master's degree in English

296
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,690
literature.

297
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,218
But a lot of the courses that I took, were with Dr. Gray,

298
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:23,250
all right?

299
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,280
And they were based

300
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,790
within Women's Gender and Sexuality studies as well.

301
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,430
And when we started a certificate here,

302
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,700
the gender studies graduate certificate,

303
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,323
I was actually the first person to graduate with that

304
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:40,350
certificate.

305
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,930
Because it was there for me, and I wanted to know more

306
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,610
of the discipline that I was working in,

307
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,192
so I took graduate level courses and got that graduate

308
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,200
certificate.

309
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,450
So I'm not only a member of this department,

310
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,880
in regards to my employment status,

311
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,970
but I am also how I like to look at myself,

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,540
you know, as a product of this department as well.

313
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,080
Because I took courses with Dr. Jacks, just like you did,

314
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,500
I took courses with Dr. Landro, I took courses with Dr.

315
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,520
Gray.

316
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,370
I took courses with, you know, a number of people

317
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,320
from the English Department as well.

318
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,030
So they're not only my working peers,

319
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,770
but they're my mentors as well.

320
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,389
So just as much as you are a student, I was a student as

321
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,400
well.

322
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,388
- Yes, yes.

323
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,930
Can you talk about your experience of taking those classes

324
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,070
and working with them over the years, office*?

325
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,548
- Okay, so it was a little bit, what, it was fabulous!

326
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,760
Because I was able to, you know, really pick

327
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,640
the brains of people that I respected, all right?

328
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,090
You know, Dr. John Landrieu, who's now retired,

329
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
you know, and who I love,

330
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,370
I took a course on him, a graduate course in masculinities.

331
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,940
And we both have a passion for sports, all right?

332
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,660
So, we were able to actually learn from one another

333
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,050
because he appreciates maybe collegiate basketball,

334
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,160
a pro basketball whereas I appreciate, you know,

335
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,400
American football and baseball.

336
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,210
And we're also both parents of sons.

337
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,430
And so we were able to bring that together

338
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,080
within the course that we took together

339
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,049
and really dive deep into what masculinity

340
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,000
within this country looks like,

341
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,670
especially in regards to, you know, sports.

342
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,440
And then also, when he was teaching an FSP on sports,

343
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,670
you know, I sat in on that course with him,

344
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,500
and actually co-taught it.

345
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,630
And so it was a fabulous experience,

346
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,480
not only for us, but also for our students.

347
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,930
And with Dr. Gray and the literature courses,

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,890
she exposed me to, you know, British lit,

349
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,160
you know, during the Victorian and Gothic eras,

350
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,200
which I absolutely love.

351
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,350
So we also, you know, working with them,

352
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,860
you know, is wonderful, but a deeper respect

353
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,080
for the knowlege they bring to the classroom.

354
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,930
and also knowing how lucky our students are

355
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,730
to be able to work with them.

356
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,820
- Talked to you earlier,

357
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,781
your affiliations with AVI living space*, Will and Shioda.

358
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,550
How did that impact your work?

359
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,610
And over the years, how has that changed you?

360
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,210
- So again, I think I mentioned that I love working,

361
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,450
you know, with students, advising them,

362
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,900
being a, you know, problem solver

363
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,750
or working with them to solve a problem.

364
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,040
So when, you know, I was asked by student organizations,

365
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,680
they need a faculty staff advisor,

366
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,500
you know, I was more than happy to say yes,

367
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,180
that I would be able to do that with them.

368
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,790
What I enjoy is when we work together

369
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,890
to sponsor an event.

370
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,890
You know, whether it was Luna fast, whether it's SlutWalk,

371
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,020
whether it's during women's history month

372
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,940
to bring in a guest speaker,

373
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,760
or they co-sponsor conferences with me.

374
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,400
So I look at it as advantageous

375
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,860
for both the department and me

376
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,840
and for the student organization,

377
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,830
that we get to participate in these different types of,

378
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,410
you know, learning experience,

379
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,350
not just in the classroom, but also outside of the

380
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,389
classroom.

381
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,380
And so I get excited by the events

382
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,340
that these organizations either put on or sponsor

383
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,680
and being able to be a part of it.

384
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,370
It's just another way for us to,

385
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,460
form these ties and connections.

386
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,910
And, you know, I enjoy being able

387
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,130
to assist the student organizations,

388
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,160
realizing that coming by a faculty and staff advisor

389
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,650
is pretty hard, you know,

390
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,590
and if they're really not asking much of me,

391
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,551
and if I can make your organised organization successful,

392
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,850
you know, I am happy to do that.

393
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,730
So I not only work with student organizations,

394
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,770
but within the college itself,

395
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,440
I sit on a number of different committees.

396
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,560
So I'm on the exec board of the staff senate,

397
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,680
here at the College of New Jersey,

398
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,490
getting to work with my co workers, as well,

399
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,680
because we have shared governance

400
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,900
and I'm sure other people have talked about that.

401
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,870
And so staff senate always has an input on,

402
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,000
you know, if there's going to be policy changes

403
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,630
that are going to affect the staff here on campus.

404
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,910
I sit on the curriculum committee

405
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,100
for humanities and social sciences.

406
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,800
So whenever new courses are being proposed

407
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
by different departments or disciplines,

408
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,450
I sit on that committee and give input.

409
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,400
And I also sit on the council for Global Engagement

410
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,270
because for the past maybe 10 years,

411
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,830
I had worked with Dr. Nicolosi in taking students abroad

412
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,990
to fact on faculty led programs abroad.

413
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,560
So we have taken students on three week,

414
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,027
you know, academic experiences to Italy, to London, and to

415
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:30,720
Ireland,

416
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,270
all different courses for WGS.

417
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,550
That give our students the opportunity

418
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,030
to study abroad if they had never been able to do it before.

419
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,365
But also if they're not able to go away for a whole

420
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:42,390
semester,

421
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,600
giving them three weeks abroad and opening their eyes,

422
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,280
you know, to other cultures, is just a fabulous experience.

423
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,692
And I think also going with students to conferences.

424
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,660
So, such as NWSA, National Women's Studies Association,

425
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,520
who had who prior to COVID had their annual conference.

426
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,150
So for about six times, we've taken students with us

427
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,980
so they can experience it.

428
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,050
And when they get to that conference,

429
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,020
it is so eye opening, because there are there

430
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,140
with 1000s of other students,

431
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,610
and they are able to sit in on panels that are are being,

432
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,597
you know, given by the people that they are reading texts.

433
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,350
So you run Angela Davis, you run into Gloria Steinem.

434
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,887
You know, you run into all of these people that you're

435
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:39,960
reading

436
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,090
and oh, there they are, they're alive person.

437
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,010
And you get to hear them, all right?

438
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,680
When they're giving either a keynote or sitting on a panel.

439
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,860
So I think that is one of the most valuable experiences

440
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,470
that our students have, you know, is going to this

441
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,503
conference.

442
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,491
- You spoke about how the clubs that you're affiliated with,

443
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,420
as well as your communities.

444
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,380
So for the events side of things,

445
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,160
what has been an amazing event that you saw start out,

446
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,430
grow into an amazing thing that is today.

447
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,560
- Ah, let's see.

448
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,800
Well, I'm really, really proud of how tri OTA* has grown.

449
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,580
Okay, you know, from starting here as a chapter,

450
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,960
and seeing it flourish, with the number of students

451
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,350
who apply to it, because it is an honor society. All right?

452
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,450
So to be able to be a part of Triaud*,

453
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,570
you haven't had a certain number of WGS courses

454
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,980
and a certain GPA, and our students have that. all right?

455
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,030
So seeing how that organization has flourished.

456
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,581
I also work with PRISM, our LGBTQ student organization.

457
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,048
And President, you know, what I'm really proud about that

458
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:01,080
is,

459
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,960
you know, it works like clockwork,

460
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,670
they understand perfectly what a student organization is,

461
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,520
how to ask for funding from Student Finance Board

462
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
and what events they are going to hold.

463
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,540
You know, whether it's through gay IPR*,

464
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,220
or LGBTQ Awareness Month in the event that they hold

465
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,230
and they always have the ball, the gay ball,

466
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,770
and raise money for different,

467
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:34,309
you know, nonprofits within our local or state community.

468
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,870
So, being in PRISM,

469
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,470
you know, also works as guidance to new organizations.

470
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,300
So, if a new organization wants to know

471
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,400
how to get their feet off the ground,

472
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,840
how does an organization run?

473
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,580
I always say take a look at PRISM.

474
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,310
Alright, because they know things they have things down.

475
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,820
Because they've been in existence for so many years, okay?

476
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,890
So of course, you would expect that.

477
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,400
But, you know, having to use them as a role model,

478
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,390
I think is quite advantageous to any new organization

479
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,620
that is faltering or not sure how to get up and get running.

480
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,340
But the events that we have co-sponsored together,

481
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,020
you know, I'm always so proud of..

482
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,320
Whether it's bringing, you know, co-sponsoring

483
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,650
the likes of Angela Davis or Gloria Steinem,

484
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,180
or in spring 2022, we are bringing Nicole Hannah Jones.

485
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,180
So, for Women's History Month, we always like

486
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,640
to have these events that are going to,

487
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,950
you know, excite students.

488
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,260
And that's what the student organizations do

489
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,200
in conjunction with the WGS department.

490
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,272
- Yes, that's amazing.

491
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,940
I love how you talked aboutf PRISM

492
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,100
and how it's definitely grown on campus.

493
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,590
Imagine the org, doesn't PRISM office and everything.

494
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,850
I feel like it's an amazing place to just be and like talk.

495
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,500
- And the students feel welcome.

496
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,770
Because now, I mean, you know, somebody coming new

497
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,900
to the college who identifies within,

498
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,980
you know, the LGBTQ plus spectrum,

499
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,370
You know, they want to have a community here.

500
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,770
And that's what these student organizations do.

501
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,826
They give the opportunity for our students to find

502
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:21,840
community,

503
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,430
and I think that's quite important.

504
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,130
- Thank you. It's been amazing talking to you, Cecilia*.

505
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,460
Is there anything else that you would like to add or say?

506
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,620
- I don't think so.

507
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,880
You know, just that I enjoy when I am here,

508
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,570
you know, in my office with the door open,

509
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,200
and that our majors feel so comfortable just coming in,

510
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,500
you know, and saying, "Hi, take a seat. We'll talk about

511
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,542
anything."

512
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,320
I think we take pride in that that we are such an open,

513
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,340
you know, discipline and department with our students

514
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,260
that they feel this connection.

515
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,720
That they can feel comfortable coming on in,

516
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,120
just taking a seat and let's talk what's going on

517
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,040
with your life and everything.

518
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,890
So building that connections with our students

519
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,410
is just an open door policy and I think that

520
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,570
is quite important for our students.

521
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,340
So I want to thank you, Lisa* for taking the time to

522
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,750
interview me as well.

523
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,782
- Yeah. Yes it's been amazing. I wanna stop the recording.
