00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,484
- [Instructor] Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:09,288
Apologies for the late start,

3
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:11,570
we just had a small technical issue.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,672
I hope everything will be resolved now.

5
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:15,195
I know there's storms all over the country,

6
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:16,560
so hopefully that won't affect us

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,845
and we'll get on with the session.

8
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:22,409
We're gonna have a look at sample paper four.

9
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:23,409
So you can use the chat, I'm here on my own,

10
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:26,999
so hopefully I'll manage to get to all the questions,

11
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:27,999
but also get them downloaded

12
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,420
and follow up with them tomorrow.

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,205
So remember this assessment is in early January,

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,630
so it's not that long the way.

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,870
We've three questions to prepare our P&L

16
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,550
and statement of financial position.

17
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,350
And then we have our cashflow

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,730
and we finally then have our consolidated statement

19
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,960
of financial position.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
So make sure that you're familiar with what exactly

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,210
is examinable for this assessment.

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,799
It's set out on page 34 of the competency statement.

23
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,850
And I remember that it's only the consolidated statement

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,270
of financial position and that's...

25
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,810
And the unlimited number of adjustment.

26
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,610
So it's really important not to go spend time doing

27
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,080
some a consolidated P&L 'cause it's not gonna come

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,319
up on the exam.

29
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,270
Now it is going to be fully online.

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,280
So there's a number of different ways to approach this.

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,340
You can submit your workings as part of it.

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,540
So it's going to be to fill in the template.

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,739
So you should be able to get the handout

34
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:19,860
there from my sessions.

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,209
I have put them in this word.

36
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,470
So hopefully that there's words and you'll be able to work

37
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,170
through as we go down.

38
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,099
Now, the notes that I'm going to work through tonight,

39
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,900
I will send them in and they'll be available

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,650
to you after the session.

41
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,090
Now, what includes the very beginning

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,170
which isn't in those handouts it's just some notes

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,500
that I made on each of the standards that's examinable.

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,599
So you'll be able to look through those and just see

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,280
in a little checklist to make sure that you're on track

46
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,860
and you know how to do various bits and pieces.

47
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,684
So we're gonna start with looking at question one.

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,509
I do have some polls but I'm a bit dubious

49
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,239
would use them given that we had a little bit

50
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,684
of technical issues there.

51
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:56,684
So again, sincere apologies for that.

52
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:00,546
I'm really sorry, and we will get started now, okay?

53
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,274
So just...

54
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:05,459
Let me check your question.

55
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,094
Yes, I'm going to upload the whole thing,

56
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:13,781
the standard, the notes that I have there tomorrow.

57
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,260
So just whatever I do here, whatever notes I type

58
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,040
in as we're going through based on questions

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,080
that come through, they will be circulated and open

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,930
the discussion forums tomorrow.

61
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,120
Now, if I was doing this paper and I spent a bit of time

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,090
thinking about how would I approach this?

63
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,100
Everybody would approach this slightly differently.

64
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,909
I probably would start with question two or question three,

65
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,180
because I feel they'd be very quick to do,

66
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,640
and I'd get a bit of confidence that I had maybe say managed

67
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,730
to save a little bit of time

68
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,779
and then I'd come back and do question one.

69
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:46,730
But again, it depends on what your feel your strength is.

70
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,080
If you don't like consolidation,

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,990
you wouldn't start with that because it's only going to kind

72
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,990
of bring you down but you'll think,

73
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,129
"Oh, I've made a mess of that."

74
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,740
So you start with whatever your best question is.

75
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,740
I'm going to work through the paper logically as it is here.

76
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:00,830
Question one and so on.

77
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,550
So sample paper four, so if you wanna make sure

78
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,879
that you have that open as we go through it now.

79
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,200
So these are the notes that I'm putting together.

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,240
It's each of the standards and just a little bit of wounds.

81
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,689
Now, obviously you have to be able to just account for them.

82
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,640
There's no narrative in this paper.

83
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,320
So just to understand the key pieces first.

84
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,510
So again, I will put those up.

85
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,930
I'll just double check that they're all the ones

86
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,219
that are examinable, that I haven't missed anything else.

87
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,460
Now with this first question,

88
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,689
as I was preparing for this session I was in two minds.

89
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,460
I was trying to put myself in your place,

90
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,240
where you going to do this exam.

91
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,189
And I suppose the folks is those in your workings.

92
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,437
I'm not sure whether I'd go straight into my workings

93
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,772
or I'd try and populate that template

94
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:44,370
with some of the information that's in the trial balance.

95
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,059
So I know I have the figures in my trial balance,

96
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,849
and then I just update as I do each of my workings.

97
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,659
I think I would probably do it that way.

98
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,740
So in the templates that I've provided,

99
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,710
the first one is everything is blank

100
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,040
and that's what I work from as we're doing here.

101
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,129
But I have a second one and it might be worth trying,

102
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:04,719
you do have the sample ones on the exam platform.

103
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,180
So for example, this one talking about,

104
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,189
I filled in the financial statements here with the figures

105
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,289
from the trial balance.

106
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,770
So I could see exactly what I had available,

107
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,960
what was there already.

108
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,109
And then once I did the workings or you just those figures,

109
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,650
and I felt, I think when I did that it took me about three

110
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,210
or four minutes to populate my template.

111
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,054
So then as I did each work and I updated

112
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,989
and then allowed to do was that at the end.

113
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,450
It doesn't matter which approach you take.

114
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,859
All of the matters is you're happy with that one.

115
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:36,780
But what I would do is I'd maybe try the template,

116
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,710
the approach of you thought that would work for you.

117
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,660
I would maybe try that on the exam platform for one of them.

118
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,320
And see, did you find it easier or did you find

119
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,230
it more difficult because this is kind of a bit different

120
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,919
to what you would have done before.

121
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,919
So make sure that you try and find a way

122
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,440
that works best for you.

123
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,460
Again, what you could actually do.

124
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,350
I have the template here in this word document,

125
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,919
so you could actually maybe cut and paste

126
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,299
and use it for the other ones

127
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,350
and still do it as I'm doing

128
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,770
it here, which is kind of closest you can get

129
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,460
to that exam platform itself.

130
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,330
So if we look at the trial balance,

131
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,460
things we need to be careful

132
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,090
about is, the first thing is the depreciation charge.

133
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,549
Now, that's depreciation charge,

134
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,950
we're looking at the financial statements

135
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,200
for the 31st December X5.

136
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
So the accumulated depreciation is all dated

137
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,640
at the 1st of January that year.

138
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,960
So that means that we haven't charged the depreciation yet.

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,410
One of the questions that I see coming

140
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,587
through in the discussion forum is in relation

141
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:36,372
to when the inventory figure in my trial balance

142
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:39,880
is not the opening figure, but it's the closing figure.

143
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,559
Okay, so that's really important that we understand this.

144
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:46,710
The inventory of the 31st of December is my closing figure.

145
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,910
So that means my opening inventory has been included

146
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,549
in this cost sales figure.

147
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:53,580
And it's just taken away the closing inventory.

148
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,890
So your cost sales is your opening inventory,

149
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,150
plus your purchases minus your closing inventory.

150
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,809
So that's what I would assume is there.

151
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,570
And then we're gonna have some other adjustments

152
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,179
that we're going to work through as we go down through this.

153
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,359
So that is one of the common questions

154
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,440
that I'm getting on the discussion forum.

155
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,260
So it's just one of those things to check before you begin

156
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,750
the question to make sure you understand it.

157
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,510
The lease liability is at the end of last year.

158
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,830
So that is the amount we owed the 17th one.

159
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,989
So the important note here under additional information

160
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,970
is unless specifically stated otherwise,

161
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,549
no adjustments had been made for the following items.

162
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:33,040
So unless they tell you this journal was posted,

163
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,809
you can assume that it hasn't been posted

164
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,330
and you need to do it now.

165
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,369
So from the past these sample packs that we have,

166
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,150
there's always a considerable adjustment

167
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,690
around the property plant and equipment.

168
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,630
So the first thing we have is it's telling

169
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,100
me that the depreciation for the year is as follows,

170
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,790
Landon buildings 5%, and it's a straight line basis,

171
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,220
planting machinery, 10% per annum

172
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,169
on a reducing balance basis.

173
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,068
So in some of the sample papers, the depreciation rule

174
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,720
has been slightly different.

175
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,280
So this one, it is the depreciation is charged

176
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,609
and the full year depreciation the year of acquisition

177
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:10,508
and does not charge appreciation of the year disposal.

178
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:12,754
In one of the other papers,

179
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:13,754
they did it the opposite way around.

180
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:15,739
They charged no depreciation to your purchase,

181
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,070
and they charge the depreciation of the year disposal.

182
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,359
So that's another key point because it's going to impact

183
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,260
huge depreciation charges.

184
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,122
The second important point here is going to be about

185
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,850
where do we charge or where do we push

186
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,910
the depreciation charge too?

187
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,734
And this second line here is critically important.

188
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,380
So we have depreciation of plant and machinery

189
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,700
should be included in cost of sales

190
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,910
and appreciation and buildings should be included in admin.

191
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,100
So you need to make sure that you get those two

192
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,890
into the right line item.

193
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,436
So two key pieces that when you read that question

194
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:55,460
(indistinct) do I charge depreciation on year of purchase,

195
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,090
or the year disposal, and do I put the depreciation charge?

196
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,609
So the first piece of information we have is during the year

197
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:04,138
they purchase plants for cash.

198
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,689
So we're gonna have to reduce our cash balance by the 180

199
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,150
and the land and buildings is trial balance

200
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,510
includes non depreciable land, 500,000.

201
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,467
On the 1st of July X5,

202
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:17,230
ANTOW sold the building for cash amount of 600.

203
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,585
The building cost 560 which included land of 100,000

204
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:24,220
when purchased on the 1st of January 2XX3

205
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,650
So we bought three years ago.

206
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,730
So we owned it for X3, X4

207
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,600
and now we're selling it at the end of X5

208
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,406
or the middle of X5.

209
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:34,850
So ANTOW remaining land was revalued for the first time

210
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,637
at the end of 20 X5 and was assessed to have a fair

211
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,940
value of 600,000.

212
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,451
So let's deal with this piece first.

213
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,761
So I would go through my adjustment.

214
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,639
Now, the reason I think that this might be a good way

215
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,470
to pre-populate it with the information the trial balance

216
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,313
is it means that you don't have to keep going back.

217
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,090
Which mean you have your information here and you work

218
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,320
from it.

219
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,250
So we have our disposal.

220
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,761
So we have the proceeds are 600,000.

221
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,832
The cost of the asset was 560 and the accumulation

222
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:22,657
depreciation, we have X3, we would have charged...

223
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,539
So this is a building that we're selling remember.

224
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,969
So it's 560 multiplied by the 5%.

225
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,019
We have X4, 560 multiply by 5%

226
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,808
and we have no depreciation in the final year

227
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,810
because we don't charge depreciation

228
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,680
in the year of disposal.

229
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,663
So the depreciation charge, I would say that should be 460.

230
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:56,173
I don't know what I'm doing there.

231
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:59,684
Because we take away the land piece.

232
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,970
So the 560 mine's the land value

233
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,659
because we don't depreciate land.

234
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,071
So that gives me 23 and 23.

235
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,690
So the carrying amount of that asset at the day of disposal

236
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,201
is 560 minus 46, which gives me 514.

237
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,454
Now, if we've managed to sell this for 600

238
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:34,911
and we had it in our books at 514,

239
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,577
that means that we've made a profit of 86.

240
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:45,066
So that is a separate line item in my template, the 86.

241
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,580
So just have a question there just to protect that.

242
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,091
So I've cut the land there included.

243
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,893
Okay, thanks for that.

244
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,810
So that's the profit there.

245
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,502
So that's going to go into our P&L.

246
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,820
That's going to increase our profits.

247
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,149
So the next thing we need to do with our depreciation.

248
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:15,649
So we have our land and buildings,

249
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,600
and we see here from the line item that the cost for land

250
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,373
and buildings was 2452.

251
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,460
But when we go down to this question,

252
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,830
it tells me that the non depreciable land included

253
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,500
there is 500,000.

254
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,324
So this 1, 952 is the 2452 minus that land of 500.

255
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,159
So we've sold an asset, and the value of that asset,

256
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,680
the buildings element was 460 and the land element

257
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,590
was a hundred, okay?

258
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,060
Now we also had the revaluation gain,

259
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,519
which we're told about their.

260
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,507
And how do I know it's a revaluation gain is 300?

261
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,830
And this last sentence here says the land was revalued

262
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,690
for the first time to 600,000.

263
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,190
So if I had 500,000 as the cost originally,

264
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,190
I disposed of land worth hundred that brings it down to 400.

265
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,560
So that goes up by 200, sorry, I go there.

266
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,458
That's a 200 increase, which brings me to my 600 value

267
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,462
in total.

268
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:23,220
So when we have this as a first time increase,

269
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,580
so when we have a first time increase on (indistinct) 16,

270
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,423
that's going to go into other comprehensive income.

271
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,627
So OCI there.

272
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,510
So the accumulated depreciation, we have that at the start.

273
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,950
We know there's obviously no depreciation on land

274
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,250
because it's an appreciating asset.

275
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,733
The disposal, the accumulation depreciation is 46.

276
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:56,019
And our depreciation charge for this current year

277
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,850
is on a straight line basis.

278
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,630
So we know revaluation gain here.

279
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,630
So the cost as at the X5 is going to be 1952 minus that 460,

280
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,076
which gives me 1492.

281
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,709
And then we have the 600 here.

282
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,630
Okay, so the depreciation remember we're told

283
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,039
in the question, that piece highlighted in green

284
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,760
there the second bullet point,

285
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,830
the full use depreciation of year of purchase

286
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,710
and none of the year of disposal.

287
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,194
So we have 1492 multiply by the 5%,

288
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,774
which gives me 74,000 to 600, 74.6.

289
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,565
So there's no depreciation on land.

290
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,720
So the carrying event is going to be the difference

291
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,269
between the cost and that accumulation depreciation figure.

292
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,480
So the accumulation depreciation at the end of the year,

293
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,340
and the buildings is 418 600.

294
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,797
And the carrying amount is 1073.4,

295
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,370
and the land is 600.

296
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,330
So the total figure that I'm going to put in for land

297
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,279
and buildings is the choke of those.

298
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,960
So that is 1673.4 so that's my land figure.

299
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,060
So you can...

300
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,620
It really is a personal choice as to whether you fill

301
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,840
in your template as you go through it, or you leave

302
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,169
it till the end.

303
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:28,169
I probably, because this will be done on page.

304
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,210
I'd probably update it as I go through it.

305
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,373
So we've two pieces of information

306
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:33,373
we're gonna put in here.

307
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,610
We have one, (indistinct) the profit,

308
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,389
and then we have the value of that building

309
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:42,239
from the land there, which is going to the 1073.4 plus 600.

310
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,659
Now, depending on the level of ranching they tell you to do,

311
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,820
these are the things probably, if you look at the solutions,

312
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,663
they round them to the nearest housing,

313
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:52,240
which sometimes goes through.

314
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,850
So just as a question...

315
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,810
Buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis,

316
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,840
which is correct.

317
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,610
So straight line basis means the same amount each year.

318
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,543
So I have charged the 5% based on the cost of the assets

319
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,820
that I still own, okay?

320
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,810
So I have to take out (indistinct) in this question tells

321
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,130
me you don't charge depreciation on the assets

322
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,169
that I don't own anymore.

323
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,633
So the last year of ownership, I didn't take them in.

324
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,480
So I did not charge appreciation of the year disposal?

325
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,690
So the assets that I own at the start and the end

326
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,350
of the year is only 1492.

327
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,019
So 5% is a straight line basis, so that's the cost figure.

328
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:32,673
The 1952 is the cost per the trial balance.

329
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:35,649
The 460 is the assets of the building,

330
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,500
the cost with that I disposed off,

331
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,416
and this figure here the cost at the end of X5 is 1492.

332
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,380
So hopefully that explains that piece there.

333
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,010
Yeah, it's just...

334
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,620
It's no problem, it's hard to follow through.

335
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,360
Haven't got the same thing at the same screen.

336
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
So we have three figures.

337
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,057
So in my trial balance, apologies,

338
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,159
I probably will move up and down the whole time

339
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,320
'cause it will be quite annoying

340
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,480
for you and for (indistinct).

341
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,399
So the providence disposal is 86.

342
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,919
It's a plus because it's going to increase our profits.

343
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,778
Okay, so that's from our first working that 86.

344
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,907
My land and buildings I have a figure here.

345
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:14,130
I'm going to round to the nearest thousand.

346
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,539
So we have 1673 is there.

347
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:19,860
Now, obviously, if I had pre-populated

348
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,610
I'd have some of these figures in already,

349
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,970
and I'd be able to just add two.

350
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,139
So might save you a bit of time

351
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,850
but I'd say try both methods.

352
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,120
And I have given it a bit of torch and I was trying

353
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,299
to decide which method would be best,

354
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,958
but I think it's an individual type thing,

355
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,529
but it's just to put that potential out there.

356
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,769
So the second adjustment, it's still

357
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:38,769
part of this adjustment.

358
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,226
One, is the depreciation on the plant and machinery,

359
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:43,740
and this is 10% reducing balance.

360
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,269
So that means it's based on the carrying amount.

361
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,263
So the important thing to remember

362
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:49,370
again here is that we've bought a new asset.

363
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,820
That's third bullet point for 180.

364
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,128
So let's look at the plant and machinery and we can see

365
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:58,528
4386 is the amount that we have.

366
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,300
And then we have the depreciation that's accumulation

367
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,270
on that, which is 680.

368
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,972
So the carrying amount is 4386 minus the 680

369
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,406
which gives me 3606.

370
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,461
And then we have purchases,

371
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,618
which from knows the bullet point there is 180.

372
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,889
So that gives me a total of 3786.

373
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,849
So we're going to charge depreciation

374
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:02,307
based on that at the ratio of 15%.

375
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,092
So that is going to give me a figure of 10%.

376
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,391
I'm just going to give you a figure of 386

377
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:16,790
(indistinct) in this room.

378
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,723
So my calculation is going to skew is 70025 (indistinct)

379
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,057
I think my math is wrong.

380
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:34,332
I think there should be 386.

381
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:37,290
And that's 3706, sorry.

382
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,774
So that gives me a figure of 386.6.

383
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,010
And remember, that's going into cost of sales.

384
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,470
The question was very clear as to where that was going,

385
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,070
the pantry machinery cost to sales,

386
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,037
and then the buildings was going into your administration.

387
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,530
So that is all of those dealt with.

388
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,704
I'm going to plug them in as we go through it.

389
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:05,489
Now, I think this next item is very interesting.

390
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,129
The disposal...

391
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:11,469
So if this 4386, what about...

392
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,351
I think that's (indistinct) disappeared.

393
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,930
Sorry, I'm not sure why that disappeared for a moment.

394
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,696
So get this 386.

395
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,099
So that's why I was getting the wrong figure in my maths

396
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,359
and my head was right.

397
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,946
So the next piece is this right-of-use asset

398
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:35,325
and this is IFS 60.

399
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:38,430
So what we have is the right-of-use assets

400
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,523
is a five-year lease ANTOW-

401
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:43,440
- [Man] You're no longer sharing your screen.

402
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,413
We can only see a connect to the webinar.

403
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,829
I think you've lost the various partner.

404
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,230
- [Instructor] Okay, yeah.

405
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,140
I think there's a bit of a delay with things

406
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,079
'cause it's on my screen for quite a while, apologies.

407
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,760
So the at least one, so the right use lease

408
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,920
is to use the us for five years on an item of plant.

409
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,643
So plant again is going to be depreciated 10%

410
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,900
on reducing bass just as we did for the other ones.

411
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,320
Normally put here because we have this lease,

412
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,720
it's going to be on the basis of that useful life.

413
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,780
So the useful life is the five years.

414
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,550
They entered the lease on the contract

415
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,609
if the 1st of January X4, so we're now at X5.

416
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:22,831
So we're in the second year of this lease.

417
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,079
Now this is a very unusual adjustment.

418
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,329
Usually most questions will give you the leads

419
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,020
from the very first day.

420
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,310
So they're obliged to make a lease payment of 20 026

421
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,320
on the 31st of December each year.

422
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,300
So that's what we call inner rears.

423
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,950
Okay, so to date the payments we made in time

424
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,933
and unfold, again, that payment may not have been reflected

425
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:45,510
in our cash because we were told the very beginning,

426
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,629
unless they tell you the transaction has been recorded

427
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,109
assume it hasn't been.

428
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:52,260
The interest rate is 5% and the end of the lease term,

429
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,800
the plant should be returned.

430
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,470
Now as I said, this was unusual

431
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,770
that we have the balance already.

432
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,660
So we know at the end of last year we can see that figure,

433
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,222
the amount we owed on the lease is 71.

434
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,165
So that's coming from there.

435
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,640
And usually as I said, it will be the first year.

436
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,600
So we could go back and work out

437
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,900
what these figures are, but we don't need to.

438
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,480
Our closing balance at the end of last year was 71.

439
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,339
And that becomes the opening balance this year.

440
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:26,400
The finance charge is going to be 5%

441
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,987
of that opening balance so that's 3550.

442
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,643
I just see a couple of questions.

443
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:32,810
I just wanted to double check,

444
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,180
so okay can see the screen now.

445
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:42,849
Has it gone again?

446
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,440
So it's 3550.

447
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,302
So I always set out my least tables in the same way.

448
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,210
When it's at least in arrears,

449
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,650
that means the payment is made at the end of the year.

450
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,987
What we do is we set it out, I set it out this way.

451
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:00,839
I have the opening balance go to add the interest

452
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,577
to it, take away the payment.

453
00:22:02,577 --> 00:22:05,079
And the reason I set it at this way is I'm gonna be able

454
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,230
to read my current and non-current liability quite easily

455
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,892
from it.

456
00:22:09,892 --> 00:22:10,892
So the capital repaid,

457
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:14,636
I'm making a total payment of 20 026 and 3,550

458
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:17,446
of that is going to be interest.

459
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:20,817
So the capsule repaid is 16476.

460
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,320
So my closing balance at the end of the year

461
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,869
is that open balance of 71 minus the capital

462
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:29,980
repaid of 16.476.

463
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,150
So that gives me 54, 524.

464
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:37,065
I just wanna check if there's any questions there.

465
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,165
So my closing balance at the end of X5 is 54 524.

466
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,859
But what I need to be able to do is split

467
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,680
that between current and non-current,

468
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,270
which is why I go to the next year.

469
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,075
So my opening balance at the beginning of next XX

470
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,839
is going to be the 54 524.

471
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:02,478
My interest is going to be 5% of that which is 5%

472
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:05,444
of 54, 524 is 2 726.

473
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:13,022
I'm going to repay 20 026.

474
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,089
So that gives me an amount that I've actually repaid

475
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,834
capital, reduce the lease liability by 17,300.

476
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,836
That's the difference between the 20 026 and the 2 726.

477
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,883
So my closing balance at the end of the year is 37, 224.

478
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,579
Now, these two figures are important

479
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,089
because they're the figures

480
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,397
that are going to be my liabilities

481
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:40,836
and my statement of financial position.

482
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,174
17 300 is going to be my current liability

483
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:48,090
and the 32, 24 is going to be my non-current liability.

484
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,410
But do it the same way I get faster

485
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,839
and they're able to do it.

486
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,839
Are you able to see my screen?

487
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,650
Just get a few messages saying it's frozen,

488
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,925
but I'm able to see up here.

489
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,710
Okay, I don't understand why that's present

490
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,129
because on my...

491
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:12,438
Are you able to see it there?

492
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:14,392
Is there any issue?

493
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:16,030
- [Man] I am moving a screen now-

494
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,251
- [Instructor] No, I'm not, I'm not doing anything.

495
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:22,520
There's a lot of people saying they can't see my screen,

496
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,609
but I haven't done anything.

497
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:28,829
- [Man] So I can see part one continued paragraph

498
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:31,290
two, three, four, five, six, seven.

499
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,858
- [Instructor] Okay, that's not what I'm looking at as well.

500
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:36,109
So I don't know what's going on 'cause I've never

501
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,070
had this problem before.

502
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,310
Apologies, I'm really...

503
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,849
Guys, I'm so sorry about this.

504
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:43,896
I don't know genuinely what's going on with the screens

505
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:47,380
because I haven't moved the screen.

506
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:50,770
- [Instructor] And I suppose if you stop sharing

507
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,089
your screen again that should.

508
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:54,935
Okay, it's moving.

509
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:57,502
- [Instructor] It's moving now.

510
00:24:57,502 --> 00:25:01,365
- [Man] So it's picked over two and two spreadsheets

511
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,230
it looks like.

512
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,550
- [Instructor] No, there's no spreadsheets open

513
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,089
on my screen.

514
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:10,006
I don't have a spreadsheet open, so I don't understand.

515
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:11,800
- [Man] Neither do I.

516
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,869
- [Instructor] Okay, I'm gonna...

517
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:14,170
I'm really sorry about this guys.

518
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,060
I'm actually gonna leave the session and try

519
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,349
and come back in because this just is mad.

520
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:21,359
It's really, it's not helping you

521
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,710
and it's causing just a lot of confusion here.

522
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,010
Does that seem reasonable?

523
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,060
- [Man] Yeah, but you just try.

524
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,186
- [Instructor] Oh by (indistinct).

525
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:31,354
- [Man] No, no, no.

526
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:33,599
If you just try and stop sharing your screen

527
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,240
and share it again, rather than leave

528
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
that might be a quicker solution.

529
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,206
- [Instructor] Okay.

530
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:49,570
So you're saying...

531
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,390
That's just nuts.

532
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,730
It asked me to share my webcam.

533
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,300
It's not asking me to share my screen

534
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
so I don't know what's happening now.

535
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,354
- [Man] Okay, hold on.

536
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,800
- [Instructor] Okay, now I can't share my screen.

537
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,070
So there's something weird going on here tonight.

538
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,436
It's back to share my webcam now.

539
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,020
- [Man] (indistinct) show you a screen at all.

540
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,557
- [Instructor] No, this is very frustrating.

541
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,520
And guys I'm so sorry about this.

542
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,720
That's the class I'm talking to.

543
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,510
- [Man] Yeah, absolutely.

544
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,859
I suppose if you leave I'll get to back down.

545
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:44,980
- [Instructor] It has come up now.

546
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,570
- [Man] Yeah and (indistinct).

547
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,394
- [Instructor] Okay, I genuinely like I don't know

548
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,411
what's going on completely.

549
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,220
Okay, so I assume people have missed all that.

550
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,450
So I'm gonna start with this lease calculation again,

551
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,524
because I don't think it's fair.

552
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:07,320
I don't think people could see it, so I'm genuinely really

553
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
sorry, guys.

554
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,144
This is just not enough fantastic experience here.

555
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,530
Okay, so we can see both sides.

556
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm now getting paranoid.

557
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,640
I can see sort of nobody else can see what I've seen.

558
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:27,052
Okay so we have the opening balance for this year at 71,000.

559
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,300
So we can see here on the trial balance,

560
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,660
71,000 lease liability.

561
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,560
So it's very unusual that we've been given the opening

562
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,543
balance because this lease is already into its second year.

563
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,820
So just to go back to the retail, it's a five-year lease.

564
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,379
So what we do is we depreciate that leased asset

565
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,290
over those five years.

566
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,849
So if we look here, we can see

567
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:51,980
that we have the right-of-use assets,

568
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,920
have a cost of 90, and we've charged

569
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,970
one year's appreciation.

570
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,609
So the depreciation on that price of use

571
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,460
answer is going to be one fifth because it's a five-year.

572
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,139
So it's going to be 18,000.

573
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,956
The next piece is that we have a five-year lease

574
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:09,485
and we have the opening balance four X5,

575
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:11,690
'cause that's the closing balance of last year.

576
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,270
So when I'm doing the lease in arrears,

577
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,119
I always set it out in the same way and at the same table.

578
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,290
So 5% of 71,000 is 3 550.

579
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,257
We paid 20 026 and the capital repaid

580
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,610
is going to be the payment of 20 026 minus the 3, 550

581
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,983
which gives me 16, 476.

582
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,010
If this is the amount of cash that I've repaid,

583
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,129
that is reducing my balance.

584
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:43,614
So the 71,000 goes down to 54, 524.

585
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,310
So again, I'm going to charge you interest

586
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,460
on that opening balance.

587
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,799
So 5% of the 54 524 is 2, 726.

588
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,560
Now I'm doing the year after,

589
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,730
because I want to know my current and non-current liability.

590
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,230
So if I can find out the amount I'm repaying capital wise

591
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,970
in X6 that's going to be my current liability,

592
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,109
and whatever is that standard

593
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:10,430
at the end of X6 is going to be my non-current liability.

594
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,017
So 20 026 minus 2, 726 gives me 17,300.

595
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,089
And that's going to be my current liability.

596
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:22,574
The next one, non-current liability

597
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:26,170
is going to be my opening balance of 54, 524

598
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,804
minus that 17 300 which gives me 37, 224.

599
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,637
And that's going to be my non-current liability.

600
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:35,510
And just gonna put it in that working

601
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,315
where I got it from in case I'm talking too fast.

602
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,004
The current liability is 20, 026 minus the 2, 726.

603
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,790
So that's a very good question.

604
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,470
What does it mean if it was paid in arrears?

605
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,010
What it means it's paid in arrears.

606
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,142
Has this gone again yet?

607
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:06,810
- [Man] Yeah, it just went, we can only see.

608
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,849
You might have to bring it back up.

609
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,220
Yeah, now it's back now.

610
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,859
- [Instructor] Okay, thanks.

611
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,680
So what are interviews means?

612
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,930
I take out the lease on the 1st of January,

613
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,170
but my payment is on the last day.

614
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,589
So I make an annual payment.

615
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:22,710
So it's the last day of that year.

616
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,349
At least in advance means I take the payment

617
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:27,690
and I make it on the day I take out the lease.

618
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,680
So there's two kind of rights of use leases

619
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,010
that you need to be able to deal with.

620
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,320
This is the lease in a rears where the payment

621
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,129
is at the end of each lease period.

622
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:41,010
So if you're paying yearly it's the last day of the year,

623
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,030
if it's at leas advance

624
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,541
I paid on the first day of the year.

625
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:49,728
So the figures that I need for my financial statements

626
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,020
are the 18, the depreciation.

627
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,800
And remember that that's on plant,

628
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,550
so that's going to be in my cost of sales as well.

629
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,315
And then I'm going to have the interest bigger,

630
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,986
which is for X5,

631
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:12,070
and I'm going to have my current and non-current

632
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,500
liabilities, which is going to be there.

633
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,399
And I have those highlighted already.

634
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,359
And I always said at least calculations

635
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,990
in the same way the table I would do for these in advance,

636
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,040
it's slightly different.

637
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,450
But once I would see that in the question,

638
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,170
I know exactly where I'm going with it.

639
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,079
So the depreciation, the right to lease asset

640
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,550
I have up there.

641
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,119
The next item is the warranty.

642
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,639
And it says the warranty for good sold

643
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,260
it's based on past experience,

644
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,079
it's estimated that in line with the terms of the warranty,

645
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,149
the provision should be adjusted to 1%.

646
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,920
So the warranty is based on good sold.

647
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,550
So we go uP&Look at our trial balance,

648
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,730
we see that our sales figure,

649
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,410
our revenue is the third last figure 2,680.

650
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,434
So we want a warranty, 2,680 by 1%.

651
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,284
So I want to have a warranty of 27.

652
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,300
So in the trial balance, we can see the last

653
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,216
line there, we've currently a warranty provision of 25.

654
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,579
So I want to increase that balance to 27.

655
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:19,349
So that's a credit balance,

656
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:21,839
so I'm going to be to increase it to 27.

657
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,010
I need to credit that warranty provision

658
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,834
and debit the provision in my trial of my expense.

659
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,027
So this too is going to go to the SOPL

660
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:32,970
and they have a separate line item first

661
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,850
and this is the figure that's going to be in my SOFP.

662
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,379
So it'd be the new balance.

663
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:40,349
It's a bit like provision for bad debts

664
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,680
is kind of the same concept that we have there.

665
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,267
So just check if there's any questions.

666
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:48,700
Yeah, that's a very good question about the lease

667
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,180
why are we using the figures for the previous years?

668
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,510
Okay, so if we look back to this one for a second

669
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,426
we can see that the closing balance last year is 54,524

670
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,770
so that's the total amount I owe at the end of X5.

671
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,770
In order to do my financial statements

672
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,950
and prepare my statement of financial position for X5.

673
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,349
I need to know that balance split between current

674
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:13,889
and non-current liabilities.

675
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:15,550
So current liabilities

676
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,290
is what I'm gonna pay back in X6.

677
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,329
So this 173 is the capital I'm going to repay X6

678
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:22,899
so that's my current liability

679
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:24,480
and whatever I don't pay an X6

680
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,991
goes into my noncurrent liabilities.

681
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,300
So we then have our inventory.

682
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,310
Now the important thing to notice here as you see,

683
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,761
I have a type (indistinct) yellow in my trial balance

684
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:41,526
that I have my stock count no at 31st December,

685
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:43,280
but at the 30th and it's 490.

686
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,669
So I have my closing inventory

687
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:46,669
posted to my accounts already.

688
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:49,109
So all I'm going to post, if there's any issue

689
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:50,800
is the adjustment.

690
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,624
So the inventory count at the 30th of December X5,

691
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,419
the inventory value as pro the trial balance

692
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,500
was based on the counter that valuation date.

693
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,889
So that was the day before our reporting date.

694
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:03,941
So transactions probably happened.

695
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,119
I'm going to need to adjust for them.

696
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,930
So that four 490 I have in my working is the balance

697
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,789
per the trial balance.

698
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:12,979
So on the 31st of December, X5 the inventory purchased

699
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:16,090
at a cost of 4,200 was received by ANTOW

700
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,073
and the sales of 20,000 were made at a gross margin of 40%.

701
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:23,690
ANTOW was correctly recorded at the purchase

702
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,620
and sale but there's not updated the inventory records.

703
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,401
So they purchase goods on the document

704
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,281
on the 31st of December, and the value of those goods

705
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,811
that they purchased was 4,200, okay?

706
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,900
So that would increase my inventory

707
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,010
because if I did the count on the 31st of December,

708
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,340
I would have an extra 4,200,

709
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,120
but I also sold goods.

710
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,789
Now what you need to be careful about with inventory

711
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:52,019
is they're telling me to say, it's for 20,000

712
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:55,160
so that's the sales price not the cost of those goods.

713
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,289
And they were sold to make a gross margin of 40%.

714
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:01,620
So I need to work at what is the cost.

715
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,539
So I'm going to do because it's the margin,

716
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,600
it's 20,000, the sales value,

717
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,150
multiplied by one minus that margin of 40%.

718
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,894
So that's effectively going to give me 12,000.

719
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,890
So if they're sold, they went in my inventory

720
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,180
at the end, the 31st of December.

721
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,023
So my actual (indistinct) inventory figure is 42.2.

722
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,050
So where people are going to go wrong on this one?

723
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,959
Is getting mixed up with (indistinct) margin.

724
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:35,624
So margin means that percentage is of the setting price.

725
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,810
(indistinct) means we add that percentage

726
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:41,030
to our coast to get to that setting price.

727
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,873
So just wanna check if there's any questions there.

728
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:47,970
There's just a question there but the least in advance

729
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,573
tape would be different, I'll come back to that.

730
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,490
I just want to finish these questions.

731
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,650
I'll come back to it at the end,

732
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,840
hopefully I'll have some time.

733
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,418
So that's just to watch out

734
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:00,030
but now the problem that this question

735
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,269
has posed for people is they also actually tell

736
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,269
it because most questions

737
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,238
you don't have the closing inventory in your trial balance.

738
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:08,660
They've gone to do an adjustment for the 482,

739
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,970
but you just went to the only for the 8,000.

740
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,150
We have 490 already in our books,

741
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,080
but it should only be 482.2.

742
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,970
So ranches would be to 8,000.

743
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,850
So just the journal would be debit your cost to sales

744
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,240
with eight and credit the inventory in the SOFP by H.

745
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:33,840
So that is the journal piece for that one.

746
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,320
The next piece we have is the dimensions were issued

747
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,209
on the 1st of January and interest

748
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:42,110
was paid on full on the 31st of December X5.

749
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,600
So the interest is paid in full,

750
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,160
but again we haven't recorded this.

751
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,862
So we look up here with 7% ventures at 1400.

752
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:57,736
So that gives me 98.

753
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,920
Now obviously if you were doing this in the exam,

754
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,620
I would just do the calculation of 98.

755
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,600
I would write my workings this journal.

756
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,360
I would just go and add the 98 to my finance cost

757
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,840
and reduce my bank by the 98.

758
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,843
If you were hand is up,

759
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:17,930
I have to show your workings,

760
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,050
which aren't showing your work as part of this solution.

761
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,229
So the next item is the courage tax per the trial balance

762
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:26,900
represents the over-provision in respect to tax charges

763
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,519
for the year ended 31st of December X4.

764
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,570
So over provision means when we put the figure

765
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,990
for our tax last year into our P&Lwe put in too much.

766
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,150
So what we do is because that's only an estimate,

767
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,059
we correct it the next year.

768
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,762
So the income tax charge for 2X5 is 76, 200.

769
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,987
So let's look open the trial balance

770
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:48,720
and we see the current taxes 12.

771
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,030
So we've put in too much last year.

772
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,892
So we have our P&L and we have the current estimates

773
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,593
is 76, 200.

774
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:02,838
And what we had was it over provision

775
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:04,910
because that's a credit balance of 12,000.

776
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,675
So in my P&Lthe charging I gonna put a 64, 200,

777
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,630
that is the figure for my P&L.

778
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,740
If I had an amount provision last year,

779
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,796
I'd add the amount to the under provision,

780
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:18,530
and that under provision would be debit balance

781
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,870
in my trial balance.

782
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,786
In my statement of financial position, my tax liability

783
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:27,312
is going to be 76,200.

784
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:32,561
So the journal is going to be to increase

785
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,269
that 12 ultimately (indistinct) 762.

786
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:37,610
So we debit our P&Lwith 6,042 in credit,

787
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,546
a statement of financial position tax liability

788
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:42,519
with the 64,200, okay?

789
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:46,197
So again that's wouldn't be aware of, and just to be aware

790
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:49,380
that you could have an under provision as well.

791
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,942
So an under provision would be a debit

792
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,640
in the TB and an over-provision would be a credit in the TB.

793
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,970
Okay, so the way I used to remember

794
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,417
it was I want the balance in my state

795
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,720
and financial position to be this year estimates.

796
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,970
So my journal is to make that correction.

797
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,680
So this last one has caused a few queries

798
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,080
in the discussion forum as well.

799
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,974
And the basis of this is that we want to match

800
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:22,979
the expense to the period

801
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:25,150
in which we're using this particular asset.

802
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,670
So on the 1st of January X5,

803
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,709
they entered into a 24 month contract

804
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:32,495
to lease office furniture with a value of 3,200.

805
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,179
The lease payments include the media's nonrefundable payment

806
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:39,881
of 1,300, and then a monthly payment of 135.

807
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,890
And that's payable at the end of each month.

808
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,550
To date all payments have been made in full,

809
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,840
and when possible they adopt

810
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,244
a policy of not capitalizing them.

811
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:51,150
So this is a small value lease.

812
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,910
So therefore we wouldn't necessarily capitalize it.

813
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,510
So let's have a look here and see

814
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,307
what are the total amount of payments and the lease.

815
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:01,240
What does the upfront fee of 1,300,

816
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,984
and then each month prepaid 135 for 24 months.

817
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,683
So the total amount of our lease payments is 4,540.

818
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,920
Now there's two years in this lease.

819
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,959
So what we want to do is we're getting the same use

820
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,650
of this asset each year.

821
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,760
So what I want to do is charge my P&L

822
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,450
half of that amount.

823
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,758
So that's 2,270 that's 4,540,

824
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:28,249
divided by two years.

825
00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:31,994
Now, that's the charge we're gonna take there.

826
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,510
So the amount we paid in the current year,

827
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,530
well what we did is we paid 1,300

828
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,850
and we also paid 12 months worth

829
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,959
of these monthly repayments.

830
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:56,320
So that gives me a figure of 2,920

831
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,720
So I paid more than I needed to pay.

832
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,880
The total charge for this lease is four or 4,540

833
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,280
half it in X5 and half it in X6.

834
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,170
So we've paid more than we needed

835
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,309
to that would give rise to a prepayment.

836
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:13,403
So 2,920 minus 2,250...

837
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,740
2,270, that gives me 650.

838
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,600
And that's going to be a prepayment

839
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,162
in my statement of financial position.

840
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:25,220
So remember we have a journal

841
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,794
that we're gonna put through.

842
00:41:26,794 --> 00:41:28,890
So the journal is going to be for the P&Lcharge.

843
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,570
We're going to debit the prepayment of 650,

844
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,740
and I need to credit the bank,

845
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,209
because again that knows the beginning

846
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:38,760
telling me if it doesn't say so we haven't done

847
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
the transaction.

848
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,530
So there are any questions in that one,

849
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,655
that one has caused a bit of an issue

850
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:44,680
because people sometimes were thinking

851
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,440
that they would put through whatever we paid,

852
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,450
but we'd go back to our cruise concept,

853
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,010
the very basics of what we started

854
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,550
off with financial accounting.

855
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,769
We're going to always only take into our accounts

856
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,240
what relates to that year.

857
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,620
So the lease payments may not be paid consistently

858
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,930
or evenly over the period

859
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,789
but we would only take what relates to each year.

860
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:05,006
So hopefully that helps with that one.

861
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:06,507
So that was all those items.

862
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:09,815
And then we have to do a P&L.

863
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,725
So we have the revenue is from the trial balance.

864
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:22,740
So we have the 2,680.

865
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,670
So I'm just going to where these figures

866
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,809
are coming from the trial balance.

867
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:33,557
I just gonna show you that they're from the trial balance

868
00:42:33,557 --> 00:42:34,979
and there was no adjustments.

869
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:36,467
I'm gonna put in the actual figures

870
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,959
in the working (indistinct)

871
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:40,530
to follow through with these numbers are coming from.

872
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,809
So we have the 1,630 for the cost of sales

873
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:45,249
from the trial balance.

874
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:49,183
We then had the depreciation on the plant and equipment.

875
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:56,097
We then had the adjustment for the closing inventory,

876
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:04,226
and we have the depreciation on the right of use asset.

877
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:07,903
So that gives me 2,044.

878
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,970
So that figure is 636.

879
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,555
We'll just...

880
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,501
(indistinct)

881
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,590
It's appreciation on the lease.

882
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,313
So the warranty expense is increasing by two,

883
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:52,070
the lease expense this is going to be for those payments

884
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,704
and where we calculate that as the 2,240.

885
00:43:55,796 --> 00:43:58,280
I'm gonna ran that to the two.

886
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,590
Now watch again the instructions

887
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,470
that you're given in the question.

888
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,470
So the administration expenses,

889
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,910
we have 174 per the trial balance,

890
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,675
and then we had 74.6, which is the depreciation

891
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,117
on land and buildings.

892
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,249
So that gives me 249.

893
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:18,840
The distribution expenses are only the figure

894
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,377
from the trial balance, which is 249.

895
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,425
The finance courses, it is 98 for the adventures.

896
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:31,745
And then we had the lease figure, which was 2.7.

897
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:40,350
That was the 54, I think, just double check.

898
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,866
(indistinct)

899
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:48,657
Yeah we had to add 35, sorry was the figure for the lease.

900
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,550
So rounding that up, we get 102.

901
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,760
So we have our profit on disposal, which was 86.

902
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,244
So the total of those costs is 518.

903
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,298
So my profit before tax is the 636 minus 518,

904
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:13,218
which gives me 118.

905
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:17,844
The income tax expense, we calculated as the 64.

906
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,630
And that gives me, we can then calculate the profit

907
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,836
for the year, which is 54.

908
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,287
So sorry, I just see a question there.

909
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,803
(indistinct)

910
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,691
Sorry, I can't read my own handwriting

911
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:38,691
I've got the figures wrong.

912
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:40,640
3,886, thank you.

913
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,229
So the other comprehensive income is the revaluation

914
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:46,050
gain on the land.

915
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,334
So the total comprehensive income is 254.

916
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,749
Now the other thing was close and a bit of issue

917
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:55,090
is people are getting a bit confused

918
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,559
but what bigger we add to the retained earnings.

919
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:00,249
This is the bigger that is going to be adjusting

920
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:01,789
my retained earnings.

921
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:04,220
The 200 here anything in other comprehensive income

922
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,439
is going to another reserve

923
00:46:06,439 --> 00:46:08,546
such as the revaluation surface.

924
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:12,462
So my plant just (indistinct) any questions on the P&L?

925
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:21,352
So my land and buildings is the 1,673.

926
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:25,011
We then have my plant and machinery.

927
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,481
So I have 3,497 per figure.

928
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,400
Sorry just get me working here.

929
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,985
We have 4,386

930
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:43,459
I can type now, we'll be doing well,

931
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:46,889
4,386 plus the 180 that we added,

932
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:51,379
we're taking away the accumulated depreciation

933
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,625
of 680 and this use charge which was the 388.6.

934
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,300
And again it's just the solution

935
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,350
didn't go to rounding (indistinct)

936
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,720
so that saves a bit of trouble.

937
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,064
The right of use asset, we had in the books,

938
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:19,675
we had 90 already minus the depreciation

939
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:23,409
at the accumulation depreciation.

940
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,160
18, which is the P&Lcharge.

941
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,039
So that brings that down to 64...

942
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,538
54.

943
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:39,265
So the total of my non-current assets is 5, 224.

944
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:43,150
My inventory is 482, or you could do 482.2.

945
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:46,010
so I put a 482.

946
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:48,269
The trade receivables don't change,

947
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:51,699
so that's from the trial balance.

948
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,110
The prepayments figure was 650.

949
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,729
So I'm just gonna put a note here because I do think

950
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:02,990
this confuses in the solution

951
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,809
what they did is they rounded it to the nearest thousand.

952
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:09,554
So that was 1000 the cash and cash equivalents

953
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:11,760
is a lot of calculations go in here.

954
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,170
So I'm just going to note them down for you.

955
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,912
I know it does refer to the workings,

956
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:17,912
but I sometimes think it's clear

957
00:48:17,912 --> 00:48:19,690
when you have the actual figures.

958
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,240
So have 876 is the figure from the trial balance.

959
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,548
We then are adding in the 600

960
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,041
from the sale of the asset.

961
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,240
We then have the purchase of assets as 180,

962
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,729
that's the plant.

963
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:45,646
We then had the 20 that we were paying away in relation

964
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,770
to the lease payment.

965
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,677
We then had 98, which was the interest.

966
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,650
And then we had the three for the other lease

967
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,800
that we paid away.

968
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,229
It's 29 and is the actual number.

969
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:14,167
It's not, I think it's 2,920.

970
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,590
And that means we ended up getting a balance

971
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,239
here of 1,175.

972
00:49:23,082 --> 00:49:24,483
So my total current assets

973
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:26,100
to me adding cross is 2,328.

974
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,785
So my total assets is 5,224,

975
00:49:28,785 --> 00:49:32,093
and the 2,328 gives me 7,552.

976
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:35,601
And that is the total of my assets.

977
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,400
Now my equity and share capital

978
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,350
is only ever going to doesn't really change

979
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,041
unless I've share issues.

980
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:46,629
That's the 3,000.

981
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:48,242
Now my retained earnings,

982
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:51,672
we have the 1,955 part of the TB.

983
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:56,329
And we're going to add on the 54,

984
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:59,039
which is 1,901.

985
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:01,823
It's from the trial balance 54,

986
00:50:01,823 --> 00:50:03,430
it's from the P&L.

987
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,880
And it's really important, but that's the profit after tax.

988
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,079
So that gives me 1,955.

989
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,509
The reevaluation services is 200.

990
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:15,517
So that gives me a total of 5,455.

991
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:20,584
My debentures are from the trial balance.

992
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,876
The lease liability is 37.

993
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,606
So that's 1,437.

994
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,970
We then have the trade payables,

995
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,920
which is again going to be from the trial balance figure.

996
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,229
The warranty provision is 27

997
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:48,220
it's the 25 plus the two.

998
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,130
The tax is going to be this year's estimates.

999
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,249
And the lease liability here is 17,

1000
00:50:53,249 --> 00:50:55,867
so that gives me 660.

1001
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:59,501
And when I add those all up, I get 7,552.

1002
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:04,209
Any questions on any of the figures, there?

1003
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:06,910
It is a lot of workings to do, so I think

1004
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,140
if I was doing this, you don't need to be going

1005
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,829
into as much detail as I am in the workings

1006
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:12,670
because you're not gonna hand those up.

1007
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,280
Your focus is to get the right figures

1008
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,030
into each of these line items.

1009
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,380
But I've highlighted the ones that don't change

1010
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,610
that are going to stay the same, those TB ones.

1011
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,749
So that's why it may be worked including

1012
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,019
those at the beginning

1013
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:27,082
and then it just as you do each of your workings.

1014
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:28,082
So that's half your marks.

1015
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:31,789
So half your time is going to go to that question.

1016
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:34,646
As I said, I think you might be a bit quicker

1017
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:35,690
getting the cashflow

1018
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,591
and the consolidated statement

1019
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:38,591
of financial position (indistinct).

1020
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:40,974
So I like cashflow and the like statement

1021
00:51:40,974 --> 00:51:43,266
of consolidated statement of financial position,

1022
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,570
because I think you can pick up marks

1023
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,650
quite easily and quite quickly in them.

1024
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:53,209
So I'm gonna have a look at these figures (indistinct)

1025
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,550
and let's see where we're at with them.

1026
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,329
So we have this information,

1027
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:00,420
we have our statement of financial position

1028
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,880
and we have our P&L.

1029
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,767
So the information that we have is that they purchased

1030
00:52:05,767 --> 00:52:07,640
a property for 1,240 during the year.

1031
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,841
So that's going to be an outflow

1032
00:52:09,841 --> 00:52:11,289
under my investing activities.

1033
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:14,380
And the depreciation charge per year was 3,190.

1034
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,930
So I have to add back my depreciation.

1035
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,913
So I'm putting that figure in on the purchase of my assets.

1036
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:27,140
I'm going to put that in there.

1037
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,499
Because I don't have any other work in Stu with them.

1038
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:32,349
They're there and there, correct?

1039
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,420
Because I've been given the numbers

1040
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,950
unless there's something else they're not going to change

1041
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:39,407
and as we go through the question.

1042
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,180
So the next piece, this is quite an interesting piece

1043
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,780
again and it's come up in quite the discussion forum.

1044
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,760
The bank deposit comprises the two following accounts

1045
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,059
as at the end of the year.

1046
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:53,289
So the first account inception date is the 1st of March X5

1047
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:56,050
as maturing on the 31st to January X6.

1048
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,855
So that has from March X5 to the 31st of January,

1049
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,910
that has 11 months and duration.

1050
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:08,120
The second one was taken at the 31st of December X5.

1051
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,849
And it's gonna mature on the 28th of February,

1052
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:14,783
note the two of these are not cash and cash equivalents.

1053
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,430
To be a cash and cash equivalent,

1054
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:20,671
it has to be highly liquid,

1055
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,940
insignificant risk and easily converted into cash.

1056
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,729
And the standard says in paragraph seven (indistinct) seven

1057
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:28,410
that has a maturity date of about three months

1058
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,229
from the day she take it out.

1059
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:33,995
So our first one has the maturity of 11 months.

1060
00:53:34,709 --> 00:53:36,990
So it is not a cash and cash equipment,

1061
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,449
even though it's gonna mature within one month

1062
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,190
at the reporting date.

1063
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,010
The second item is the cash and cash equivalent

1064
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:46,280
because it has a maturity date of just two months

1065
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,479
from when we took it out.

1066
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:51,447
So this 300 is not part of your cash and cash equivalents.

1067
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:53,700
So it's an investment that we made.

1068
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,209
So that investment

1069
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:58,059
goes in there too in my investing activities.

1070
00:53:58,059 --> 00:54:01,761
And it is maturity longer than three months.

1071
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,610
So that is the root.

1072
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,320
So that's has caused queries because people think,

1073
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,519
well I should include the two of them.

1074
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,140
They had problems reconciling at this answer.

1075
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,510
So that is the main reason for that form.

1076
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,519
So that's my two adjustments Delta.

1077
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:26,410
So how do I tend to go through this.

1078
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,920
I go up to the start because I wanna make sure

1079
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,680
that I'm going to deal with every line item and get it in.

1080
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,579
If I work from the top of my cashflow,

1081
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:35,930
I'm kind of jumping all over the place

1082
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,640
and I'm not sure that I've covered everything.

1083
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,860
Now because of the template,

1084
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,840
you're probably going to cover everything.

1085
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,410
So it doesn't really matter as much but for the end

1086
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:46,290
of the year exam, it kind of will impact quite a bit.

1087
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:49,300
So we have a property plant and equipment,

1088
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,630
and we can see from here that we've profit on sale

1089
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,550
of the non-current assets.

1090
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,252
And we have purchases, we filled in already,

1091
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:59,070
and the receipts from the sale of property

1092
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,289
plants, and equipment.

1093
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:02,979
Now when I'm doing this adjustment,

1094
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:06,186
I tend to do as T account.

1095
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,950
So what I have is my opening balance

1096
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,209
is the figure that I'm taking from X4,

1097
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:17,919
which is 3,289.

1098
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,934
So what I'm going to add to that are my additions,

1099
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:24,963
which I know from note one are 1,240.

1100
00:55:24,963 --> 00:55:28,787
So I'm checking to see here we have a revaluation.

1101
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,459
We can see that the reevaluation reserve

1102
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:41,117
for surplus has increased from 250 to 850.

1103
00:55:42,979 --> 00:55:46,288
So that's an increase of 600.

1104
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:54,553
Now what we'll have reduced my figures in the year.

1105
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,120
Well, I've charged appreciation

1106
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,982
and we know the demand of the depreciation is 3,190.

1107
00:56:02,853 --> 00:56:06,610
And I know that my closing balance in my accounts

1108
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,973
is 28,580.

1109
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:16,785
Okay so just checking there's a question there.

1110
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,039
Guess you are given a template,

1111
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,559
so it is you populate that in the exam.

1112
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,818
So that's part of online extent

1113
00:56:24,818 --> 00:56:26,315
there should have been a note sent

1114
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:28,349
out to you which set out some information in relation to it.

1115
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:30,440
So I'd get them to send it out to you again,

1116
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,332
but there is a template that you complete.

1117
00:56:33,332 --> 00:56:34,974
So it's a fully online exam

1118
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,650
and that's why you can get the results quite quickly back.

1119
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,035
So we have all these figures

1120
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:42,559
but what we know is that we sold some assets.

1121
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,720
How do I know that?

1122
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,930
What the template is telling

1123
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,349
me their receipts from sale and we know that was a profit.

1124
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:51,140
I look at my P&LI can see that there's a profit

1125
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,060
on disposal of 105.

1126
00:56:55,182 --> 00:56:57,950
The revaluation figure, good question.

1127
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:58,950
Going to show you now.

1128
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,570
So we go back up here to the revaluation service.

1129
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,660
So you see under equity and reserves there.

1130
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,294
We have revaluation surplus 850 this year

1131
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:10,440
and 250 last year.

1132
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,373
So our assets have gone up in value by that event, okay?

1133
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,890
So that's 600.

1134
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:22,720
Now in order for this account to balance,

1135
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,927
the disposals should balance it off.

1136
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:28,410
So if I go with my children's here.

1137
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:32,133
I have 1,840 so I think that gives me 31,259.

1138
00:57:34,537 --> 00:57:35,950
That's just 259.

1139
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,461
I've never been the wrong way round.

1140
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:41,993
So 92...

1141
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:50,861
32,199.

1142
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,979
Okay 32,199.

1143
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:56,630
But over on this side you can see the 3,190

1144
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:00,217
and the 28,580 do not add up to 32,199.

1145
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,190
They add up to a different figure.

1146
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,262
So it's going to be lower.

1147
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:08,769
So to balance that up, this is my balancing figure

1148
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:10,090
and to balance this account up.

1149
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:13,269
So they both total up to 32,199

1150
00:58:13,269 --> 00:58:17,113
I need to include the depreciation figure of 359...

1151
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,141
Our disposal figure of 359.

1152
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:33,365
So balancing figure 359.

1153
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,103
So if we...

1154
00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:42,137
If the carrying amount of that asset

1155
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,694
so we have to carry to match the asset is 359.

1156
00:58:47,979 --> 00:58:50,559
And if we look at our P&Lhere we can see

1157
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,868
that we made a profit of 105.

1158
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,959
There are no marks for workings in the assessment.

1159
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:07,079
So you're simply using the template

1160
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:09,200
and then it's coming up

1161
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,550
so you're not actually getting that piece.

1162
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,720
Is that showing okay now?

1163
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:18,608
Can you see my two screens

1164
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:20,670
- [Man] No the screens gone again (indistinct).

1165
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,410
- [Instructor] Okay.

1166
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:23,780
- [Man] No its gone again.

1167
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,590
- [Instructor] Okay, is it there now?

1168
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,329
- [Man] It's not, now we (indistinct).

1169
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:29,490
- [Instructor] Yeah, it's I don't know

1170
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,539
what's going on in tonight.

1171
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:33,150
If it just goes, can you give me a shout?

1172
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,820
Because otherwise I could be rattling onto myself.

1173
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:37,970
Okay, so the caring method-

1174
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,970
- [Man] Yeah, of course, it was only gone

1175
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,420
for two or three seconds.

1176
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,470
- [Instructor] Okay, perfect.

1177
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:44,090
So we can see that there's a profit on disposal.

1178
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,559
So if there's a profit on disposal,

1179
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:49,150
that means that I sold it for more than the carrying amount.

1180
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,737
So that means it's 464 is the proceeds.

1181
00:59:56,403 --> 00:59:59,914
Okay, so that's a kind of a lengthy,

1182
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,979
it's probably the most complication adjustment

1183
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:02,979
you're going to get in that.

1184
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:03,979
So I'm just gonna...

1185
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:07,229
I want to have them on the same page

1186
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,110
together so you can see it.

1187
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,349
Okay, so the 359 is the balancing figure

1188
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:13,579
and that's how we get it.

1189
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:17,303
464 is going to be my proceeds from that sale

1190
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:18,369
of that asset.

1191
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:20,320
Well, I wasn't given it, the only reason I knew to do

1192
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,360
it in this particular instance

1193
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,269
was because there's a template that tells

1194
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:26,781
me that there was a receipt proceed.

1195
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,999
So I actually have to invest in activities completed there.

1196
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:36,843
So I've dealt with my property plant and equipment,

1197
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,590
inventories is always this movement here.

1198
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:42,650
So if my inventories have increased,

1199
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,550
it means have more cash tied up.

1200
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:48,448
So it's going to be a reduction in the cash available.

1201
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,696
So I'm going to just take away that profit on disposal,

1202
01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:56,820
which I've picked up from the P&L and the finance cost...

1203
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,860
I'll go back to those in a second.

1204
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,579
So the increase or decrease the trade receivables,

1205
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:05,345
so if we look here at the current assets in X5,

1206
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,291
we had 24 ratio and in X4, we had 2,260.

1207
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:16,119
So what has happened is my assets,

1208
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:17,880
my investment inventories is increased

1209
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,329
so that means I have less cash available.

1210
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:25,010
So we do the maths 2,480 minus 2,260 is 220

1211
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,881
so that is reducing my cash.

1212
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:35,050
My trade receivables and X5,

1213
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:38,559
we can see that the trade receivables were 3,590

1214
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,801
And in X4 they were 3, 980.

1215
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,690
So they've gone down so that means my customers

1216
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,559
are paying me more quickly

1217
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,070
so that's increasing my cash available.

1218
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,440
So the increase in that is 390.

1219
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,579
My trade payables, let moved down here.

1220
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,037
We can see that they've gone in X5

1221
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:08,540
3,066 was last year

1222
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,930
X4, they were 2, 570.

1223
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,490
So what we've done is my trade payables have increased.

1224
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:17,979
I'm taking longer to pay my suppliers

1225
01:02:17,979 --> 01:02:19,440
so I have more cash available.

1226
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,184
So that again, it's increasing my cash by 496.

1227
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,119
So my cash generation operations,

1228
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,570
I can't quite fill that in yet

1229
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,110
'cause I'm missing a couple of figures.

1230
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,900
So I just wanna get the numbers in first

1231
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,789
and then I'll come back to it.

1232
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:35,688
So we've dealt with the inventories trade receivables.

1233
01:02:35,807 --> 01:02:38,369
I'm now on the cash figures.

1234
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:42,072
So we have cash has moved from 835 to 7,313.

1235
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:45,920
So if we go down to this piece,

1236
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,800
my cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year

1237
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:57,050
are the 835 only.

1238
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,871
And at the end of the year,

1239
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:10,082
they are the 7,313 plus, if we go down to this note,

1240
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:14,700
the investment that we made that has that short-term

1241
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,311
maturity, which is the second one there.

1242
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:22,329
The 1700 is included.

1243
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,581
So that brings me to 9,013.

1244
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,434
Hey, we do not include the 300

1245
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:32,749
'cause we've included it here because it's maturities longer

1246
01:03:32,749 --> 01:03:34,490
than three months.

1247
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,406
So we've now dealt with all of our assets in our books.

1248
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,130
So we've got all the way down to there.

1249
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,749
If we look at our share capital,

1250
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:45,869
we see that what's happened is the share capital

1251
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:48,690
has increased from 18 to 20 million.

1252
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,410
And the share premium, which tells me that we issue

1253
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,030
those shares of both their nominal value

1254
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,249
that is also increased.

1255
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:58,994
So proceeds from my share issue we have in X5,

1256
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,369
we have a figure of 20,000 or 20 million

1257
01:04:08,369 --> 01:04:09,849
plus the four million.

1258
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:13,849
But in X4, the figures were only 18 million in share capital

1259
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,269
and three million in share premium.

1260
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:20,843
So this year we have 24 million sitting in our share ratio

1261
01:04:20,843 --> 01:04:24,272
compared to 21 million last year.

1262
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:28,440
So the value of the share ratio to me is three million Euro.

1263
01:04:29,209 --> 01:04:30,880
The movement in both of those figures

1264
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,685
combined the share capital and the share premium.

1265
01:04:34,979 --> 01:04:38,224
So we've dealt with the revaluation surplus already.

1266
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:42,123
The next figure that we have is the retained earnings.

1267
01:04:42,289 --> 01:04:45,670
So the retained earnings figure will move

1268
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,869
because of the profit for the year,

1269
01:04:47,869 --> 01:04:50,979
and will move because of any dividends that I've paid.

1270
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:54,113
So how I always calculate this with no dividend liability.

1271
01:04:54,113 --> 01:04:57,740
So I have my opening retained earnings of this written down

1272
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,449
somewhere here.

1273
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:06,775
So dividend is equal to opening retained earnings

1274
01:05:07,262 --> 01:05:10,395
plus profit for the year

1275
01:05:12,249 --> 01:05:15,709
minus the closing retained earnings.

1276
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:19,167
So we go to my balance sheet here.

1277
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:23,670
My opening retained earnings is the 10, 724.

1278
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:27,494
I'm going to add to that, the profit for the year.

1279
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,720
So good into my P&L.

1280
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,505
And we can see the profit for the year is 2,248.

1281
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:37,746
We're going to take away the closing retained earnings,

1282
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:41,746
which is 12,572.

1283
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:51,158
So that will give me a figure for my dividends of 400.

1284
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:59,952
So I've paid the dividends, we can see the 10, 724

1285
01:06:00,313 --> 01:06:04,118
plus the 2, 248 gives me 12, 972, which is higher

1286
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,979
than that 12 572.

1287
01:06:05,979 --> 01:06:09,660
So that tells me I've paid some money away.

1288
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:15,750
So I've paid the 400.

1289
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,090
The next item we have is the debentures.

1290
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,720
And we can see that the balance has increased.

1291
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,400
Last year it was two million

1292
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,450
and now it's two and a half million.

1293
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:31,758
So that's an increase of 500.

1294
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:36,770
So again, I've all these items so we have the tax figure.

1295
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,789
So the tax figure, how I always calculate

1296
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,959
is both in current liability plus P&L

1297
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:47,092
minus closing liability.

1298
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,944
Thanks, so we look at my open liability, it's 820,

1299
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,260
my P&L charge is 880.

1300
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:11,230
And my closing liability is 975.

1301
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:18,211
So 820 and 880 gives me 1, 700.

1302
01:07:18,211 --> 01:07:21,822
1700 minus 975 gives me a figure of 725.

1303
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,742
That is the amount that I've paid way.

1304
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:30,155
Okay, now, so the difference is that the figure

1305
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:33,050
that's in my P&L is what we estimate

1306
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,150
but if I have an opening and closing liability,

1307
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:37,119
I have to adjust it for that.

1308
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,657
The finance cost there's no liability

1309
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,780
so that means whatever the figure is in my P&L

1310
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,833
I've actually paid it.

1311
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,380
Okay, so we have to add the finance cost

1312
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:07,347
back here, because we want to show that we wanna make sure

1313
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,660
that we can see that wherever you can include

1314
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,249
the finance cost in any of the three sections.

1315
01:08:12,249 --> 01:08:13,940
So depending on where you're pushed in we always add

1316
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:14,940
it back.

1317
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,960
We start with the profit before tax

1318
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,200
and that is in my question at 3, 128.

1319
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,965
So we have the 3, 190, the 105, the 125 income,

1320
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:30,067
the 220 all flown out to 90.

1321
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,383
So that gives me a cash generated from operations of 6, 154

1322
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:39,160
in total, so that's that 3, 128 increasing

1323
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,468
by all of these figures here.

1324
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,697
So we have two outflows which is 850.

1325
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,690
So when we take that away we get...

1326
01:08:56,690 --> 01:09:00,060
I'm sorry, that's (indistinct).

1327
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:01,790
You can't, they don't look

1328
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,430
for that in this particular question,

1329
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,370
they don't look for the cash generation from operations

1330
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,700
so I wouldn't put it in.

1331
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,870
So just or they do sorry.

1332
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,913
704, take away the 850.

1333
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:23,234
We have 6, 154 as the net cash used

1334
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,726
from operation activities.

1335
01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:29,799
So all of the figures, some of the figures

1336
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:31,259
are quite easy to pick.

1337
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:33,580
We'll just take a little bit of calculation.

1338
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,270
So obviously you can't record any of the workings

1339
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,940
within this, you're gonna have to do those separately.

1340
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,111
Now, the good thing about the cashflow

1341
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:43,049
is if doesn't balance up you know that you have to go

1342
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:44,838
and find the figure and it's...

1343
01:09:44,838 --> 01:09:47,650
It might be only one figure that you put us in close

1344
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,650
rather than the minus.

1345
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,410
So can be quite quick to find and compared to other

1346
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,560
financial statements.

1347
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,719
So that is a handy pieces.

1348
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,820
So the cash flow from investing activities is 1,076

1349
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:58,820
of an airflow.

1350
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,644
And then our info from financing activities is 31.

1351
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,890
So we have more cash coming in that we have go (indistinct).

1352
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:10,788
So my increase in cash and cash equivalents is 8, 178.

1353
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:14,634
We started with 835 so therefore that brings us up

1354
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,870
to the 9, 103.

1355
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:21,280
So we should be able to reconcile the net increase

1356
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,400
should be the difference in those cash and cash equivalents

1357
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,280
at the start and the end of the period.

1358
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,850
So the key piece from this question

1359
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:29,290
for me, would be calculating

1360
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:30,593
that disposal carrying an event,

1361
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:34,160
and then understanding that the cash and cash equivalents

1362
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,877
is that ratio about timing that impacts that bigger

1363
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:38,784
and to be able to do that.

1364
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:42,110
So if there any questions there?

1365
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,820
You're all very quiet.

1366
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,564
You must like cash flows or at some cashflows.

1367
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,469
I had some cutoffs and nobody can hear me.

1368
01:10:50,469 --> 01:10:53,711
I'm just talking to myself.

1369
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,580
Absolutely, the cash at the end of the year.

1370
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,780
So that's a good question.

1371
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,580
And it's quite a confusing because it doesn't come up

1372
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,540
into many questions.

1373
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:08,477
So if I just go back here, so the key piece (indistinct)

1374
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:10,790
the cash at the start and end of the years,

1375
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,878
we have these two lines here.

1376
01:11:12,878 --> 01:11:16,758
Now, also remember that we could also have overdrafts

1377
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,009
coming in here.

1378
01:11:19,009 --> 01:11:21,670
So we have the cash is 835.

1379
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:23,900
We had no bank deposits so that's why the cash at the end

1380
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,440
of the year are the cash and cash equivalents

1381
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,969
is only the 835.

1382
01:11:26,969 --> 01:11:30,309
But we have the 7,313 in cash.

1383
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:34,267
But we also have this 2,000 in our bank deposits.

1384
01:11:34,267 --> 01:11:37,128
But we have to go down to look at note two here.

1385
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:40,240
And note two is critical

1386
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,410
because this is telling me that I have two these make up

1387
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,670
that 2,000.

1388
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:48,181
One of them has a 10 month maturity.

1389
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,339
I took it out in the 1st of March and it matures

1390
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:53,490
in the 31st of January X6.

1391
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:55,647
So that is not a cash and cash equivalent

1392
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:59,076
because the maturity is too long.

1393
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,302
Okay, just that I wrote this down somewhere,

1394
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,259
but it could be losing your mind.

1395
01:12:06,259 --> 01:12:09,689
Okay, so we add in the 1700 only.

1396
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:13,657
So I'm just gonna put in a note.

1397
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:42,330
With insignificant risk.

1398
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:45,814
Per IAS seven, the paragraph seven.

1399
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:54,204
It says investments with a maturity date of...

1400
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,969
And the word that says upstate three months.

1401
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:06,176
So if we have the 324 223,

1402
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,907
this is not a cash and cash equivalent.

1403
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:22,690
As the maturity is 11 months from date was taken out.

1404
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:33,474
Okay, so cannot be a cash and cash equivalent.

1405
01:13:40,299 --> 01:13:43,887
755, 634, 657 as three months maturity.

1406
01:13:50,678 --> 01:13:53,732
I'm sorry, two months.

1407
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:01,189
So is a cash and cash equivalent,

1408
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:05,406
because the maturity date is shorter than that.

1409
01:14:05,406 --> 01:14:08,780
All right, that's another good question there.

1410
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,690
About the indirect and direct method.

1411
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,636
Now, in the competency statement, it's on by page 36,

1412
01:14:14,636 --> 01:14:18,441
it says that you don't have to know both methods,

1413
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:22,924
so about to calculate the operation profit.

1414
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:31,727
You only need to know the indirect method.

1415
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,222
Say note in competency statement on page 36.

1416
01:14:47,603 --> 01:14:50,719
It just give the information on the three formats

1417
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:51,719
of questions?

1418
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:55,320
The three types of questions you can have and that's there.

1419
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,870
Question two is always a cashflow.

1420
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:00,150
So again, that note on page 36,

1421
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:02,850
it sets out what the three questions would be.

1422
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:04,486
So per question will be the P&L

1423
01:15:04,486 --> 01:15:06,160
and statement of financial position.

1424
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,629
Two would be the cashflow,

1425
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:10,339
and then the third one is going to be consolidation.

1426
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,430
But I think this was an interesting piece

1427
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,080
about that cash and cash equivalent.

1428
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,180
And I'd expect the number of people to get that wrong

1429
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,799
because you can easily kind of forget about it.

1430
01:15:18,799 --> 01:15:19,799
And just focus on the both investments.

1431
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:22,556
So therefore they both go in.

1432
01:15:22,556 --> 01:15:25,427
So question three.

1433
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:31,070
Now I really like consolidation because based on the number

1434
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,940
of adjustments you can have here,

1435
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,486
it's quite a good question too.

1436
01:15:34,486 --> 01:15:38,419
So what we're simply doing is we've three working to do.

1437
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,365
My goodwill, my consolidated retained earnings,

1438
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,419
and then my NCI figure, okay?

1439
01:15:45,419 --> 01:15:48,230
So again you need to know the two methods.

1440
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,390
So it's, again, that page 34 and 36,

1441
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:53,150
give all that information.

1442
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:55,585
Yeah, actually it is quite difficult sample paper,

1443
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:57,110
and that's kind of why I picked

1444
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:59,379
it because I thought it'd be worthwhile.

1445
01:15:59,379 --> 01:16:01,305
I think there's a few little tricks in it.

1446
01:16:01,305 --> 01:16:02,930
It has the two types of lease.

1447
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,280
It has this one in it.

1448
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,969
So the sample papers should give you a broad overview,

1449
01:16:06,969 --> 01:16:09,400
but when I looked at them at the very beginning

1450
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,240
and I thought, well, at first you the hardest one

1451
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,580
as we could talk through it, rather than picking

1452
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:18,120
the easiest one and that one so hopefully,

1453
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,710
and again, the technology issues tonight,

1454
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,180
I'm really, really, sorry.

1455
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:24,691
It just hasn't helped the situation.

1456
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,480
So I'm gonna have a look at this one now.

1457
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,430
So we have the company purchased an extra share in SUSTAT

1458
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:37,830
and the financial statements of the two companies are here.

1459
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:39,919
So there one figure I can fill in immediately

1460
01:16:39,919 --> 01:16:43,503
and that is the share capital because unless the payables

1461
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:44,503
is the subsidiary by ratio and shares,

1462
01:16:44,503 --> 01:16:47,190
it's good for the payables share capital that goes in.

1463
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:49,200
So in the 1st of January X5,

1464
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,043
the parent PAMRAL purchase 75% of the share capital

1465
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,509
for the cash amount of 220 per share required.

1466
01:16:56,509 --> 01:16:57,780
So we have to..

1467
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,690
We can see now appear, do they have the investment in SUSTAT

1468
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:05,370
they have it there in the parent of 4, 950.

1469
01:17:09,879 --> 01:17:11,879
But again, I would check that that figure is right,

1470
01:17:11,879 --> 01:17:15,400
that they have records as well just to be my paranoid self.

1471
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,602
So the fair value of the net assets,

1472
01:17:16,602 --> 01:17:18,750
and SUSTAT were equal to their book value

1473
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,750
with the exception of the building.

1474
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,733
I heard the fair value is 300,000 XXS with carrying amount.

1475
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:27,270
So this answer was not at its fair value

1476
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:28,860
in the subsidiaries books.

1477
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,860
So we have to then adjust for that because we wanna take

1478
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,913
in the correct amount.

1479
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:41,660
So I'll come back to that lease question

1480
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,700
when they've finished this.

1481
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,984
So the retained during some SUSTAT is 2.625 million

1482
01:17:45,984 --> 01:17:47,700
at the 1st of January,

1483
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,759
and the company has a policy of measuring

1484
01:17:49,759 --> 01:17:52,426
the non-controlling interest acquisition

1485
01:17:52,426 --> 01:17:53,570
at the proportion of share fair value.

1486
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:57,375
So that means old goodwill relates to the parent.

1487
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,839
So we have to calculate the proportion of chairman at assets

1488
01:18:00,839 --> 01:18:02,219
that NCI figure.

1489
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,918
Now we have three adjustments.

1490
01:18:03,918 --> 01:18:07,703
We during X5, PAMRAL who's the parent sold goods

1491
01:18:08,169 --> 01:18:10,759
to SUSTAT for 600,000 and the record,

1492
01:18:10,759 --> 01:18:13,036
the profit on the margin of 30% with sales.

1493
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:15,610
The course of these goods remain on hand.

1494
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:18,129
So for this one, the important thing to point out

1495
01:18:18,129 --> 01:18:20,549
is the unrealized profit adjustment

1496
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:22,370
relates to the good still on hand.

1497
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:25,100
So that's a quarter of the total sales and the adjustment

1498
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,984
goes into the company that sold the goods within the group.

1499
01:18:28,984 --> 01:18:32,759
And goodwill impaired is not examinable for the assessment.

1500
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:35,400
Again, page 34 lists down those different words.

1501
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,887
I don't unfortunately have a printed here to hand

1502
01:18:37,887 --> 01:18:40,040
that list sit down.

1503
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,180
On the 31st of December X5, they recorded receivable

1504
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,576
is 200,000 in respective of goods.

1505
01:18:45,576 --> 01:18:49,089
So SUSTAT and the corresponding credit balances

1506
01:18:49,089 --> 01:18:52,553
the SUSTAT does not agree due to cash of 20,000

1507
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:55,361
that was sent by SUSTAT has not yet been received.

1508
01:18:55,361 --> 01:18:59,127
So the SUSTAT has paid 20,000 of its liability.

1509
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,250
So they don't have a liability 200,000.

1510
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:06,120
They have a liability of 20,000 less which is 180.

1511
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,290
So we need to cancel out all the inter group balances

1512
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:11,111
and transactions and consolidations.

1513
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:14,359
So the trade receives the parent is shown 200,

1514
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:17,180
but the subsidiary is shown 180.

1515
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,890
So the difference is cash and transit

1516
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:21,600
so we need to adjust for that.

1517
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,280
So on the 31st of December land with the carrying value

1518
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:28,178
of 200 was transferred to SUSTAT at nil consideration.

1519
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:33,089
So the problem is when PAMRAL got

1520
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:36,839
that, they have it at a zero cost,

1521
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:40,174
but we can't make profits or we can't make losses

1522
01:19:40,174 --> 01:19:41,600
by transferring goods.

1523
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,870
So it has to be at the cost to the group.

1524
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:46,640
So going to start off with the goodwill calculation.

1525
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,342
So I'm taking that 4, 950 from the statement

1526
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,298
of financial position of the parent.

1527
01:19:53,298 --> 01:19:55,960
Now I'm gonna have to calculate the NCI,

1528
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,530
the acquisition date, I don't have that yet.

1529
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:02,497
So the share capital, I'm just gonna put in another column

1530
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:05,706
in my table.

1531
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:22,500
So I'm gonna put that 4, 950 over here, so we can see

1532
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,370
what the figures are coming from.

1533
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:27,790
So at the acquisition date and that's the key piece here.

1534
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:30,460
We want to know what was the share capital

1535
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,960
of the subsidiary,

1536
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,140
but it hasn't changed since the acquisition date.

1537
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:38,480
So it's three billion, SOFP (indistinct) SUSTAT

1538
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,049
statement financial position, the retained earnings.

1539
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:42,852
Are we given that, it just means we can see

1540
01:20:42,852 --> 01:20:45,247
that we both at the start of the year,

1541
01:20:45,247 --> 01:20:48,839
so we can see in 0.3 there, the retained earnings

1542
01:20:48,839 --> 01:20:51,660
which were 2,625.

1543
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:59,614
So that is coming from note three in the question.

1544
01:21:04,919 --> 01:21:07,701
So the 4,950 has come from...

1545
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:10,740
If we look at the statement of financial position

1546
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,673
of the parent, we can see here, the investment in SUSTAT

1547
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,950
is there 4,950.

1548
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:21,830
So that is the same figure it's coming in here, okay?

1549
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,520
So the fair value adjustment,

1550
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,761
we can see here in note two

1551
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:34,697
that we have the 300,000, the fair value of the net assets

1552
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:38,839
required equals the book value with the exception

1553
01:21:38,839 --> 01:21:42,584
of a building that had a fair value of 300,000

1554
01:21:42,879 --> 01:21:44,560
in excess of carrying amount.

1555
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,700
So if they'd reflect

1556
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:49,150
to that, they would have a higher value there.

1557
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:52,089
So the net assets at the acquisition date

1558
01:21:52,089 --> 01:21:54,070
are made up of those three components

1559
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:55,857
with the 3 million share capital,

1560
01:21:55,857 --> 01:21:58,500
the 2.625 retained earnings

1561
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,620
and the 300 fair value adjustment.

1562
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:03,586
So that gives 5,925.

1563
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:08,210
That is the net assets in the soap at the acquisition date.

1564
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:11,129
Now, the NCI we're told in the question is measured

1565
01:22:11,129 --> 01:22:13,450
at the proportionate share of net assets.

1566
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:16,285
So we've just calculated the net assets of 5,925

1567
01:22:16,285 --> 01:22:19,392
and that's a star note one there we're told

1568
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:22,098
that the parent bought 75%.

1569
01:22:22,098 --> 01:22:25,350
So if the parent both 75% of this company,

1570
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:28,170
the NCI owns 25%.

1571
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:32,356
So 25% of 5,925 is going to give me 1,481.25.

1572
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,182
So 4,950 plus 1,481.25 minus the 5,925

1573
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:51,800
gives me goodwill 506.25.

1574
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,890
So that's my goodwill figure

1575
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,780
and that goes into my consolidated

1576
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:02,180
statement of financial position.

1577
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,450
So hopefully everybody's happy with where those figures

1578
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:08,852
have come from and they make a little bit of sense.

1579
01:23:08,852 --> 01:23:11,680
Again, I would have a way of working

1580
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,890
through this which is going to be the easiest.

1581
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:15,770
If you have a method it's going to be much faster

1582
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:17,897
to do than if you have to think through every step.

1583
01:23:17,897 --> 01:23:20,330
So that's getting me some marks

1584
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:22,610
and that goes into my statement of financial position.

1585
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:25,343
Now my consolidates retained earnings will go in to start

1586
01:23:25,343 --> 01:23:28,150
with the figures for retained earnings,

1587
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:32,117
from the statement of financial position of the companies.

1588
01:23:32,169 --> 01:23:35,740
So we can see there that the retained earnings are 8,410

1589
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,530
and 4,020.

1590
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:40,129
Now the consolidate retained earnings figure

1591
01:23:40,129 --> 01:23:43,259
is made up of the parents retained earnings,

1592
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:46,457
plus the groups share or whatever profit the subsidiary

1593
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:49,360
has made since the acquisition date.

1594
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,560
So I'm going to take

1595
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,283
away from this, from the subsidiaries figure,

1596
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:57,710
the retained earnings at the acquisition date,

1597
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:00,419
which is 2,625.

1598
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,894
So that 2,625 is the same figure that I used here.

1599
01:24:08,759 --> 01:24:12,565
So whatever figure I put in there, I put in here.

1600
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,410
So same number.

1601
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:22,377
So since we bought the subsidiary, we have managed to make

1602
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:29,042
the figure off 1,395 I think.

1603
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,969
That gives me that figure.

1604
01:24:41,969 --> 01:24:44,790
So the depreciation of the fair value desert.

1605
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:48,352
So we're going to go to this note two.

1606
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,500
So just in the question,

1607
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,846
the information for this is coming from note two.

1608
01:24:54,846 --> 01:24:57,477
So what we have is this fair value adjustment

1609
01:24:57,477 --> 01:25:00,848
the 300K and we're going to depreciate

1610
01:25:00,848 --> 01:25:03,870
that because we're increased in by 300,000,

1611
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,730
we would charge more depreciation.

1612
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:08,187
And that's over 20 years.

1613
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:12,067
So we bought the subsidiary at the start of the year.

1614
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:16,770
So it's only one year's worth of depreciation.

1615
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:19,610
So we need to reduce if the subsidiary

1616
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:21,560
has national fair value that assets,

1617
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,150
it hasn't charged that extra depreciation.

1618
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,839
So the at the acquisition date,

1619
01:25:26,839 --> 01:25:29,310
the subsidiaries assets are faire valued.

1620
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:33,054
So they get the depreciation adjustment force.

1621
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:39,251
So the UOP is coming from the next piece

1622
01:25:39,839 --> 01:25:42,969
here which is note four.

1623
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:44,800
Oops.

1624
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,969
So the goods sold were 400,000.

1625
01:25:51,969 --> 01:25:55,868
Now in this question the company that sold these goods

1626
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,860
was the parent.

1627
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,169
So they are getting the adjustment

1628
01:25:59,169 --> 01:26:01,530
in their financial statements, okay?

1629
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,419
Because they are the setup

1630
01:26:03,419 --> 01:26:05,690
so they made this old realize profit

1631
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:07,089
because we don't recognize a profit until

1632
01:26:07,089 --> 01:26:10,140
we sell the goods outside of the group.

1633
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:12,810
So selling them between the two group companies

1634
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:14,310
doesn't make me a profit.

1635
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:16,439
So we formed a thousand to sales,

1636
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:19,607
and we're told that a quarter of these are still on hand.

1637
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:22,847
So we can see there 400,000 for quarter profit

1638
01:26:22,847 --> 01:26:24,799
and the margin of 30% on sales.

1639
01:26:24,799 --> 01:26:26,669
A quarter of these are still on hand.

1640
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:29,820
So quarter on hand because you just did only for the goods

1641
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,820
on hand.

1642
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:34,585
So we sold these goods to make a margin of 30%.

1643
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,201
So 30% of that selling price was prefaced.

1644
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:41,986
So 400 by quarter is 100 by 30% gives me 30,000.

1645
01:26:44,571 --> 01:26:46,790
And again it's in the parents books

1646
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:50,706
because the parents sold those goods to the subsidiary.

1647
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,600
This last adjustment which is from note six in the question,

1648
01:26:56,423 --> 01:26:58,030
it's very unusual.

1649
01:26:58,030 --> 01:27:00,150
Because what's happened is this subsidiary

1650
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,410
has transferred in asset so they have this sitting

1651
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:06,339
in their books at 200 and they transferred it for no money.

1652
01:27:06,339 --> 01:27:09,790
So they've recorded a write-off, a loss.

1653
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:12,100
So we need to add that back.

1654
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,330
So again, that's quite unusual.

1655
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:15,219
Sorry, I just have one question here.

1656
01:27:15,219 --> 01:27:17,820
If requires a subsidiary halfway through the year,

1657
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:18,890
yes so you would...

1658
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:19,890
That's a really good question.

1659
01:27:19,890 --> 01:27:22,031
If we didn't own the subsidiary for the full year,

1660
01:27:22,031 --> 01:27:24,129
we'd have to adjust that bigger.

1661
01:27:24,129 --> 01:27:26,430
So that's really good so they tell you.

1662
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:29,631
If the UOP said 50% mark of what group multiplied by.

1663
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,589
So just I'll do that UOP,

1664
01:27:31,589 --> 01:27:32,959
that's a really good question about the UOP.

1665
01:27:32,959 --> 01:27:35,831
So just down here.

1666
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:39,402
So what if price was set

1667
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:45,776
based on a mark up of 30%?

1668
01:27:46,337 --> 01:27:49,100
Now just again I will send you an order of these notes.

1669
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,930
So any questions that I've recorded down

1670
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:52,993
based on people ask me will be intuitive.

1671
01:27:52,993 --> 01:27:55,709
So the adjustment would be a bit different.

1672
01:27:55,709 --> 01:27:58,973
Again we'd have this revenue, we'd have the quarter.

1673
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:02,379
What would happen is now we'd want, need to multiply

1674
01:28:02,379 --> 01:28:06,165
it by the mark up divided by 100 plus a mark up.

1675
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:12,750
So that would be 400K multiplied by a quarter

1676
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:15,991
multiplied by 30, over 130.

1677
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,450
So that would be how we would calculate it.

1678
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:21,810
So it would be a different figure.

1679
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:25,653
Sorry just get a calculator to get work connection.

1680
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:42,514
The 400 (indistinct) 100 multiply by 30, over 130,

1681
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:50,940
which gives me about 23,003.07K

1682
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:56,100
So that would be, it'll give you a different figure,

1683
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,650
but it's handy to be able to see that calculation

1684
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:02,339
there because it is one that's easily confused by people.

1685
01:29:02,339 --> 01:29:04,040
So now I've all my adjustments still.

1686
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,980
The key piece is to make sure that I record

1687
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:09,878
them in the right column who made that profit or loss.

1688
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:13,892
So as a result of this parent's figure

1689
01:29:15,669 --> 01:29:18,436
is down to 8,380

1690
01:29:18,879 --> 01:29:22,152
and the subsidiaries figure is increased by 200

1691
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:25,833
to 1,595 minus the 15, which gives me 1,580

1692
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:29,799
Now, that 1,580 is all of the profits

1693
01:29:29,799 --> 01:29:32,820
that the subsidiary has made since the acquisition date.

1694
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:36,346
But the parent is only entitled to their share of it.

1695
01:29:36,346 --> 01:29:40,262
So that's 1,580 by 75%, so when I multiply that by 75%,

1696
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,746
I get 1,185.

1697
01:29:44,786 --> 01:29:47,205
So the figures it's going to go into my consolidated

1698
01:29:47,205 --> 01:29:50,840
statement of financial position is 9,565.

1699
01:29:57,078 --> 01:29:58,372
Okay, so that's the figure

1700
01:29:58,372 --> 01:29:59,914
that's going into my consolidated

1701
01:29:59,914 --> 01:30:01,100
statement of financial position.

1702
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,690
So now that I have that piece, John,

1703
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,722
nearly half my three workings

1704
01:30:04,722 --> 01:30:07,969
that I need to do as to wait.

1705
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:11,937
So my NCI figure is based on this number that I calculated

1706
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:16,579
at the beginning, the 1,481.25

1707
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:24,450
and it's going to be a share of that 1,580.

1708
01:30:32,290 --> 01:30:35,210
And then we have...

1709
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:42,310
Which gives me 395.

1710
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,900
So the figure that's going into my consolidated statement

1711
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:51,357
of financial position is 1,876.25.

1712
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:07,320
So they're the numbers.

1713
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,595
So this is from working one,

1714
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:12,040
and then the second piece is coming from the NCI

1715
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,459
share of that working too.

1716
01:31:14,459 --> 01:31:16,360
And I have my figure then for my consolidated

1717
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,610
statement of financial position.

1718
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:20,110
So there's the three workings,

1719
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:23,459
key piece is to get the depreciation figure right

1720
01:31:23,459 --> 01:31:27,219
and then to make sure that you attribute the adjustments

1721
01:31:27,219 --> 01:31:29,350
correctly to the parent or subsidiary.

1722
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,664
So we work at the post acquisition profits.

1723
01:31:31,664 --> 01:31:34,200
So we're going to have a look here and see

1724
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,820
what the calculations are.

1725
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:39,730
So it's important to remember which assets were revalued

1726
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:42,259
or fair valued at the acquisition date.

1727
01:31:42,259 --> 01:31:45,180
So it would just...

1728
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:53,070
So the land if I move disappear,

1729
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:58,280
we have from the parents statement of financial position,

1730
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:05,707
I have the 4,000 4 million plus the 1,250.

1731
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,890
And then I'm adding back the 200,

1732
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:12,452
which was the land transferred at nil.

1733
01:32:12,628 --> 01:32:15,810
Hey we should have that huge in our financial statements

1734
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:17,770
at the full amount, we shouldn't have reduced

1735
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:20,000
it out like that because we want to show

1736
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,275
it at the cost of the group.

1737
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,243
So that's going to give me a figure of 5,450.

1738
01:32:29,379 --> 01:32:32,540
The buildings we have to figure of 6,240

1739
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:33,540
from the parent.

1740
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:36,060
So I have to try a battle or the same financial position

1741
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,419
there beside us from the parent and the 2,380

1742
01:32:39,419 --> 01:32:40,680
from the subsidiary.

1743
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,799
But at the acquisition date we were told

1744
01:32:42,799 --> 01:32:46,229
that we had the fair value of 300

1745
01:32:48,259 --> 01:32:51,379
and then we had to take away the depreciation

1746
01:32:51,379 --> 01:32:53,100
that was on the fair value adjustment.

1747
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,734
So the figure that we have here is 8,905.

1748
01:32:58,017 --> 01:32:59,870
Plant and machinery is a nice figure

1749
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:02,690
because it is simply adding two figures

1750
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:04,500
in the parents and subsidiaries books,

1751
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:08,219
there were no adjustments, the 8,350 and 1,850

1752
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:11,677
So that will give me 10.2 million.

1753
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:14,696
The goodwill is coming from my working one.

1754
01:33:14,696 --> 01:33:17,940
And we worked at the goodwill at 506.

1755
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:20,169
Number five down here.

1756
01:33:20,169 --> 01:33:22,686
oops, 506.25

1757
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:27,660
So again I'm not including the decimal places.

1758
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,660
So you may get a slight random difference

1759
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:31,290
because it is hard and an exam

1760
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:32,973
to get the rounding exactly right.

1761
01:33:32,973 --> 01:33:35,833
You can increase and decrease one, chose that out.

1762
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:38,650
That's the important thing to know is this figure,

1763
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:40,799
the investment in stash and the parent

1764
01:33:40,799 --> 01:33:43,400
isn't showing at the consolidated financial statements.

1765
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,592
What we show instead is the goodwill figure.

1766
01:33:45,592 --> 01:33:48,640
So the (indistinct) cover and non-current assets

1767
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:51,003
is 25,061.

1768
01:33:51,839 --> 01:33:54,150
The inventory figure.

1769
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:55,810
Again if we look at our statements

1770
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:56,940
of financial position there,

1771
01:33:56,940 --> 01:34:00,802
we have the 5,210 plus the 1,150 and the subsidiary.

1772
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,810
But we're going to take away that on realized property

1773
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,419
adjustment of 30.

1774
01:34:07,419 --> 01:34:09,259
So the inventory is going to be reduced

1775
01:34:09,259 --> 01:34:12,871
and it's going to be presented at 6,330.

1776
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:16,480
The trade receivables again is the parent's figure

1777
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:20,017
of 4,680 plus 980 for the subsidiary.

1778
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:22,969
But we're going to take away the 200,

1779
01:34:22,969 --> 01:34:26,650
we'll go back to this adjustment down here.

1780
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:31,079
Note five at 31st December, X5

1781
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:36,005
it was received well in the parents books of 200

1782
01:34:38,594 --> 01:34:40,607
and respect to goods, the corresponding credit balance

1783
01:34:40,607 --> 01:34:43,070
and the subsidiary was only 180.

1784
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:46,402
And that was because of the cash in transit.

1785
01:34:46,402 --> 01:34:48,469
So we add those up there.

1786
01:34:48,469 --> 01:34:51,745
So we get a figure of 5,460.

1787
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:03,576
Prepayments(indistinct) prepayment to this.

1788
01:35:03,576 --> 01:35:04,576
I don't know why but I think I copied

1789
01:35:04,576 --> 01:35:05,950
it down from the first one.

1790
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,043
So you can ignore that.

1791
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:14,120
Cash and cash equivalents we have the parents figure

1792
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,040
there is the 2,570.

1793
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:21,370
And we have the 8,880 and we then have to add the 200

1794
01:35:24,341 --> 01:35:27,878
or the 20 that's cash and transition.

1795
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,483
Now in the solution it says that that's a minus 20,

1796
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,790
but that's incorrect, it should be a plus 20

1797
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,980
because the figure won't work out to the figure

1798
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,320
in your statement of financial position,

1799
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,750
which is 3,470.

1800
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:42,793
So that is increased, so just to show you that (indistinct)

1801
01:35:42,793 --> 01:35:46,250
because it can be a bit confusing.

1802
01:35:54,509 --> 01:35:56,299
The intra group balances.

1803
01:35:56,299 --> 01:35:59,700
So we have debit trade payables.

1804
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:05,967
We have credit the trade receivables.

1805
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,870
So from the notion and the question,

1806
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:12,803
we know that the trade receivables has a balance of 200.

1807
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:17,299
And we note that the trade payables have a balance of 180

1808
01:36:17,299 --> 01:36:18,930
net that is balance off.

1809
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:22,400
The difference between them is the cash in transit.

1810
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,549
The trade payables are lower because the subsidiary

1811
01:36:24,549 --> 01:36:26,868
has made a payment away, it just hasn't reached

1812
01:36:26,868 --> 01:36:29,450
the parents yet.

1813
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,450
So we are debiting increasing the cash

1814
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:35,543
in the group by the 20.

1815
01:36:39,272 --> 01:36:40,272
And again, I had a couple of queries

1816
01:36:40,272 --> 01:36:41,272
coming through the discussion

1817
01:36:41,272 --> 01:36:42,700
forum because of that title that was in it.

1818
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:44,620
So its 3,470

1819
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:48,322
So the total of my current assets is 15,260.

1820
01:36:49,009 --> 01:36:52,521
So I get 14,321 for my total assets.

1821
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,000
Every figure you get, right?

1822
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,549
You're getting marked for at these templates.

1823
01:36:58,549 --> 01:37:00,290
So bear that in mind,

1824
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:03,597
the share capital is the parent holding.

1825
01:37:03,597 --> 01:37:06,200
In this particular situation,

1826
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,390
the share premium is the parent holding

1827
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:11,549
because there's no balance in the subsidiary.

1828
01:37:11,549 --> 01:37:14,167
If there was balance you'd have to do the same

1829
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:16,610
kind of calculation that you do for retained earnings.

1830
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:20,219
So working to, we calculated the retained earnings

1831
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:22,860
figure at 9,565.

1832
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:26,540
The revaluation surplus is going to be 400.

1833
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:32,560
It's the parents only because there is no revaluation

1834
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,830
balance in subsidiary.

1835
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:38,510
So we total all those up and we get 26,940.

1836
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:42,391
The NCI figure is from my working three.

1837
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:47,153
And that gives me 1,876

1838
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:50,499
So the total equity is 31,841.

1839
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:58,339
The noncurrent liabilities is going to be made up

1840
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:02,290
of the parents 3.5 million and the 650 in the subsidiary.

1841
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,653
So that gives me 4,150.

1842
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,490
The current liabilities,

1843
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:13,860
the trade payables is the 3,690

1844
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:17,085
plus the 820.

1845
01:38:18,379 --> 01:38:21,864
So that gives me a figure of 4,330.

1846
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:26,700
So when I add those all up together,

1847
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:29,219
I total equity and liabilities

1848
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:32,273
is going to be 40,321.

1849
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:36,959
Now again, you could just have a small round indifference,

1850
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:38,310
which should be okay.

1851
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:40,820
Shouldn't cause any major issues, but what's...

1852
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:43,839
I think what's good to see here is some of these figures

1853
01:38:43,839 --> 01:38:46,480
are simply adding the parents

1854
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,418
and subsidiaries figures together.

1855
01:38:49,418 --> 01:38:52,384
So we have that one.

1856
01:38:56,277 --> 01:38:57,397
The share capital is straightforward

1857
01:38:57,397 --> 01:38:59,730
and the parents share premium in this instance,

1858
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,180
and the revaluation surplus

1859
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:05,009
are also just the parents figures because of the details

1860
01:39:05,009 --> 01:39:06,169
in the question.

1861
01:39:06,169 --> 01:39:08,490
We have the long-term borrowings

1862
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,959
is simply the (indistinct) together

1863
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:14,160
as are the trade payables.

1864
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,680
We have figures that are coming

1865
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:19,680
from as specific calculation, which is the retained earnings

1866
01:39:19,998 --> 01:39:23,427
and the non-controlling interest.

1867
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:28,810
So we're going to do three specific workings

1868
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:31,810
and all of the adjustments come from those.

1869
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:34,560
So there are some questions I'm sure from earlier sessions

1870
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,560
that you would have covered,

1871
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,839
you would have some other practice questions of this.

1872
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:41,500
So just there the tree specific workings,

1873
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:44,100
but where you have to consolidate retained earnings

1874
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,009
that's where you get lot of the other figures

1875
01:39:46,009 --> 01:39:47,469
that are go to just here.

1876
01:39:47,469 --> 01:39:50,469
Just sorry, I have a question here from (indistinct).

1877
01:39:50,469 --> 01:39:51,890
Should you write your short notes workings

1878
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:53,616
in the columns in the exam.

1879
01:39:53,616 --> 01:39:55,070
I'm not actually quite sure

1880
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:57,740
if you can do that, if you can add in those workings,

1881
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:59,397
I think you can only just put in the figure.

1882
01:39:59,397 --> 01:40:02,350
So I think you'd have to do that yourself.

1883
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:04,459
So this is why it's really important to do that practice

1884
01:40:04,459 --> 01:40:07,553
run on the test system.

1885
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:10,152
I haven't had a chance to go into it yet.

1886
01:40:10,152 --> 01:40:11,820
I do plan to go into and have the same

1887
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:13,562
thing I can put up and the discussion forum,

1888
01:40:13,562 --> 01:40:15,610
I will put it up in relation to it.

1889
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:18,430
So from my understanding of the system,

1890
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:21,410
all you'd be able to do is put in that 5,450

1891
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:22,780
you wouldn't be able to put in a note

1892
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:26,291
as to how you arrived at that 5,450.

1893
01:40:27,256 --> 01:40:28,350
So I think it's really important to have a good

1894
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:31,839
go ask those two test assigned to know you have a limited

1895
01:40:31,839 --> 01:40:32,839
number of attempts

1896
01:40:32,839 --> 01:40:35,240
at them but I would try and do go get a study

1897
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,240
before you do it.

1898
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,339
So you get a good run at it and you're able to then focus

1899
01:40:38,339 --> 01:40:41,211
on how you use it.

1900
01:40:41,409 --> 01:40:42,770
So if the answer was 850 and we were asked

1901
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:44,855
to round to the nearest 1000

1902
01:40:44,855 --> 01:40:46,850
you would leave it at 1000.

1903
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:50,615
So if anything is over the five, so it was 650.

1904
01:40:52,464 --> 01:40:55,606
So in that first question, I the prepaid to 650,

1905
01:40:55,606 --> 01:40:57,700
but I put it in as a thousand.

1906
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:00,874
So anything over 500, I'd round up to a thousand

1907
01:41:00,874 --> 01:41:03,549
and if it was below 500,

1908
01:41:03,549 --> 01:41:06,180
I'd put it in as a zero.

1909
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:09,859
So just again, watch the instructions in the question.

1910
01:41:09,859 --> 01:41:12,383
And I think that's the benefit of having the test system,

1911
01:41:12,383 --> 01:41:14,759
that you can actually see how that rounding works,

1912
01:41:14,759 --> 01:41:16,094
but it can...

1913
01:41:16,094 --> 01:41:17,650
The ranching can show out something

1914
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:19,820
because you may have an imbalanced because you're around

1915
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,549
and figures rather than the whole lot.

1916
01:41:21,549 --> 01:41:23,089
And so that's quite important.

1917
01:41:23,089 --> 01:41:26,933
Now somebody had asked me about a lease in advance.

1918
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,999
So how would I set it up?

1919
01:41:30,999 --> 01:41:34,744
So I'm just going to do a quick template here.

1920
01:41:35,641 --> 01:41:37,070
I have a couple of minutes.

1921
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:39,020
You'll probably all hope and that I'd finished early.

1922
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,530
But sorry.

1923
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:42,982
And again it's sincere apologies, but the issues earlier,

1924
01:41:42,982 --> 01:41:45,320
I'm kind of frustrated by it myself,

1925
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:46,940
and I'm sure you are as well.

1926
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:48,799
So we have the opening balance of the year,

1927
01:41:48,799 --> 01:41:51,190
the opening balance with the payment...

1928
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:54,283
Oops done that already.

1929
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,370
You open balance payment, just a balance interest,

1930
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:05,360
closing balance.

1931
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,544
So now not going to make up these figures

1932
01:42:07,544 --> 01:42:11,288
because obviously I haven't worked at out yet.

1933
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:23,945
So say it's a 10% and then the closing balance.

1934
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:27,049
So if I was doing this at least in advanced,

1935
01:42:27,049 --> 01:42:29,127
so say it was 2020,

1936
01:42:29,127 --> 01:42:32,850
and my opening balance was 100 and I paid 15.

1937
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:35,669
So when I made that payment,

1938
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:38,450
the balance immediately came down to 85.

1939
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:41,955
Interest is 10% of that 85, which is 8.5,

1940
01:42:41,955 --> 01:42:45,440
which brings my balance up to 93.5.

1941
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:50,365
So that's the 85 plus 8.5.

1942
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:54,515
So my closing balance of 2020

1943
01:42:55,556 --> 01:42:59,472
would become my opening balance of 2025, which is 93.5.

1944
01:43:00,062 --> 01:43:01,622
Again, I paid the 15,

1945
01:43:01,622 --> 01:43:04,008
you just have balance goes down to 78.5

1946
01:43:04,008 --> 01:43:07,976
and the interest is 7.85, which brings that to up to 83...

1947
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,771
Hopefully my maths is working okay, .35.

1948
01:43:15,919 --> 01:43:19,763
So in the statement of financial position for 2020,

1949
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,860
what we need is a current liability

1950
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:28,400
and the non-current liability.

1951
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,950
So the current liability, the non-current liability

1952
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:33,740
is going to be the amount that I got to have to pay back

1953
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:34,740
more than one year.

1954
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,825
So that's always going to be the 84.35.

1955
01:43:36,825 --> 01:43:40,283
That is closing balance from 2021.

1956
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:45,644
My current liability is going to be the amount

1957
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:51,959
that I'm paying back in the following year.

1958
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:55,235
So that is going to be 7.15.

1959
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:02,969
I'm sorry if I typed, but I say it would be great.

1960
01:44:02,969 --> 01:44:06,832
So that is the 15 payment in 2021 minus the interest

1961
01:44:08,919 --> 01:44:11,686
in 2021 of 7.85.

1962
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:14,919
So hopefully my maths is correct there.

1963
01:44:14,919 --> 01:44:18,126
So if we add those two up,

1964
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,825
I don't mind that somewhere wrong along the way.

1965
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,406
I think that should be 85.

1966
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:39,566
86.35, my maths...

1967
01:44:39,566 --> 01:44:42,808
I'll just do my maths here.

1968
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,788
86.35, so 86.35 and then 715.

1969
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,290
And that gives me the total balance.

1970
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,330
So that will be how I would do it.

1971
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,410
It's a rough example, but numbers they will balance up

1972
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:02,410
to anything else.

1973
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:06,044
So apologies am again really disappointed

1974
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:07,969
with the way the piece went at the beginning,

1975
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:10,509
but I think it'll settle down after awhile.

1976
01:45:10,509 --> 01:45:11,580
So there are any other questions.

1977
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:14,080
Is there anything else anybody wants me to go through?

1978
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,169
I'm happy to do a quick.

1979
01:45:15,169 --> 01:45:17,169
We have a few minutes in cases,

1980
01:45:17,169 --> 01:45:20,669
any of the questions and things that I missed

1981
01:45:20,669 --> 01:45:22,230
from early round that I was to go back to.

1982
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:25,169
I think that was one of the things at least in advance.

1983
01:45:25,169 --> 01:45:27,819
Anything else?

1984
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:28,910
You're all going...

1985
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:29,910
We're too tired Margaret,

1986
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:33,367
go away and stop asking questions.

1987
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:35,290
Cashflow, why is it debenture?

1988
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:37,040
Is a positive, bigger, very good question.

1989
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,959
So just to be quick load, look at that one.

1990
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:43,745
So if we go back to our debenture question here.

1991
01:45:44,379 --> 01:45:47,230
So if we look so it's important though, is to keep track.

1992
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:49,520
So we have X4 and X5.

1993
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,285
So this column here we have debenture last year

1994
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,410
with two million and our liability is increased.

1995
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:58,120
So we must have borrowed more money.

1996
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,020
So for my debenture we think about to increase

1997
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,240
those ventures who must have credited the ventures.

1998
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,640
So we got cash in, so it's a debit.

1999
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,589
So my dimensions alone increasing

2000
01:46:06,589 --> 01:46:08,150
needs I'm getting cash in.

2001
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:10,219
If my debenture balance was going down,

2002
01:46:10,219 --> 01:46:13,504
I'm making a payment, so it would be an outflow.

2003
01:46:13,504 --> 01:46:15,270
So that's why that is I'm a cash inflow

2004
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:18,754
because we're borrowing more money.

2005
01:46:19,709 --> 01:46:22,350
Any other questions?

2006
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:25,221
Six minutes to go.

2007
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:27,620
So as I said, I will put those notes up

2008
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,520
with everything in it.

2009
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,810
So apologies are quite big prints that make the big prints,

2010
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:32,937
so that have you had them printed off

2011
01:46:32,937 --> 01:46:35,419
and we're trying to write on, it would make a little bit

2012
01:46:35,419 --> 01:46:37,040
easier and I'll have a couple of multiple choice

2013
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,469
in there that I'll go through.

2014
01:46:38,469 --> 01:46:40,526
Texts in question one.

2015
01:46:40,526 --> 01:46:42,812
Absolutely, no problem, go back to that one now.

2016
01:46:42,812 --> 01:46:46,446
Oops, I think I've probably gone too far.

2017
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:55,900
So in this trial balance, what we have is this line item.

2018
01:46:57,009 --> 01:47:00,890
We have the current tax and I have a liability, okay?

2019
01:47:01,709 --> 01:47:03,810
So we've 12 sitting there.

2020
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:07,320
So what people tend to forget when they're learning

2021
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,520
accounting first of all,

2022
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,740
is that tax charge we put P&L is our guests

2023
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:14,042
because obviously it has to go through the texting

2024
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:15,923
and we'd have to then find out

2025
01:47:15,923 --> 01:47:18,120
what it is because could be allowances

2026
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,030
that we haven't taken into account.

2027
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:23,339
So if you imagine, and I sometimes find this as the easiest

2028
01:47:23,339 --> 01:47:26,370
way to explain it to people.

2029
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:28,392
So I'll just take this through.

2030
01:47:28,392 --> 01:47:30,890
So imagine this is the first year

2031
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:34,634
and we have a tax expense that we put through.

2032
01:47:35,509 --> 01:47:39,426
So this is my tax expense and this is my tax liability.

2033
01:47:57,890 --> 01:48:01,374
So year one, we have tax liability.

2034
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:09,850
We told that our tax liability was going to be 50.

2035
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:13,437
So year one, we have tax expense is 50.

2036
01:48:15,169 --> 01:48:19,169
So what we did at the end of the year is we took that figure

2037
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,310
to my P&L.

2038
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:24,252
So at the end of the year, my tax expense is cleared out.

2039
01:48:24,252 --> 01:48:26,299
And at the end of this year,

2040
01:48:26,299 --> 01:48:28,959
we have a balance of 50 on which we're going to pay

2041
01:48:28,959 --> 01:48:31,140
some time in the new year.

2042
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:34,890
We might pay it this year based on tax return dates

2043
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:36,070
and all the rest.

2044
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:40,020
So we have this balance that we start the next year with.

2045
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,408
That would be at the start a year two.

2046
01:48:48,408 --> 01:48:52,358
And what happens is we then make the payment in year two.

2047
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:56,504
And that payment turns out to be only 45.

2048
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,732
So we now have a balance

2049
01:49:07,129 --> 01:49:09,379
of 45, 5,000.

2050
01:49:09,379 --> 01:49:12,030
So that's the balance is arisen because the amount we paid

2051
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:13,900
was different.

2052
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:16,629
And that said that 12 is sitting there and those financial

2053
01:49:16,629 --> 01:49:19,243
statements, because we put into a P&L last year,

2054
01:49:19,243 --> 01:49:22,549
12,000 more than we actually ended up paying.

2055
01:49:22,549 --> 01:49:25,089
So because that 50 is an estimate,

2056
01:49:25,089 --> 01:49:28,410
what we have to do then is corrected the following year.

2057
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:31,276
Because if you think about any (indistinct) estimates

2058
01:49:31,276 --> 01:49:32,792
under ISA, what we do is we make an estimate.

2059
01:49:32,792 --> 01:49:36,089
We know it isn't going to be a hundred percent correct.

2060
01:49:36,089 --> 01:49:38,232
So when we get more information, we correct it.

2061
01:49:38,232 --> 01:49:41,493
We (indistinct) and issue financial statement.

2062
01:49:41,493 --> 01:49:43,839
You don't go back and amend the previous years.

2063
01:49:43,839 --> 01:49:47,563
So we go back up to our question that we had.

2064
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,320
So my tax charge in my P&L

2065
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:00,831
is going to be the current estimate.

2066
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:05,270
And it's going to be increased by under provision

2067
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:08,363
that we made last year.

2068
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:13,560
So in other words we took into the P&L

2069
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,430
less than we paid out

2070
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:19,132
or an over-provision that we made last year.

2071
01:50:20,529 --> 01:50:22,530
And the result of that is that if we have an under provision

2072
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:26,190
we'd have a debit figure for our tax and try balance

2073
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:28,570
it be even over over-provision we have a credit figure

2074
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:31,520
and my trial balance.

2075
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,020
So what we have to do is to work at the P&L charge.

2076
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:37,299
We take this year's estimates, the 762

2077
01:50:37,299 --> 01:50:40,757
which has given them the question.

2078
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:49,922
And then we have the 12,000, which is trial balance,

2079
01:50:50,049 --> 01:50:52,699
credit figure.

2080
01:50:53,995 --> 01:50:55,169
And then that gives me the P&L,

2081
01:50:55,169 --> 01:50:58,975
but the tax liability is always issues estimates.

2082
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:04,400
So the way I can remember studying this years ago and kind

2083
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,484
of getting a bit confused about it, because it is confusing

2084
01:51:06,484 --> 01:51:07,656
(indistinct) is 12.

2085
01:51:07,656 --> 01:51:08,820
Do you think we'll actually owe more money?

2086
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:12,030
And what I used to always think about was I need

2087
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:15,641
that current tax liability to be 76,200.

2088
01:51:16,089 --> 01:51:19,645
If I have 12,000 sitting there already,

2089
01:51:19,645 --> 01:51:21,950
the P&L figure must be the difference.

2090
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:24,629
It has to be 64,200 to be focused on what the journal

2091
01:51:24,629 --> 01:51:26,530
is to change the current tax figure

2092
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:28,727
it's always much easier to work out.

2093
01:51:28,727 --> 01:51:31,839
So you think we need that balance 3,762

2094
01:51:31,839 --> 01:51:33,610
I have 12, so therefore my journal

2095
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:36,767
has to be for less than (indistinct)

2096
01:51:36,767 --> 01:51:38,030
it has to be the 64.

2097
01:51:38,030 --> 01:51:40,390
So hopefully, and that makes a lot of sense.

2098
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:43,910
It is a little bit confusing of fully accept that.

2099
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:47,040
So it can take a little bit of time to work through.

2100
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:50,379
Are there any other questions?

2101
01:51:55,629 --> 01:51:57,759
Absolutely, so there's a good question

2102
01:51:57,759 --> 01:52:00,190
in the depreciation's list with land and buildings, yeah.

2103
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:02,570
Sometimes in questions they push...

2104
01:52:02,570 --> 01:52:03,922
You can see here in this one,

2105
01:52:03,922 --> 01:52:06,089
they have land and buildings combined together.

2106
01:52:06,089 --> 01:52:08,120
So the problem is with the depreciation

2107
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,810
here it says land and buildings

2108
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:12,219
and I can see why this is causing a bit of confusion,

2109
01:52:12,219 --> 01:52:14,669
but we do not depreciate land.

2110
01:52:14,669 --> 01:52:18,428
So it probably would be clearer if this said buildings

2111
01:52:18,428 --> 01:52:22,031
rather than land and buildings, because we don't depreciate.

2112
01:52:22,031 --> 01:52:24,150
And I can understand how maybe if somebody read

2113
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:26,799
that they would then go and charge the 5% on the land

2114
01:52:26,799 --> 01:52:27,799
as well.

2115
01:52:27,799 --> 01:52:29,450
But it's actually I've looked at this question

2116
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:31,209
a couple of times and I've never twigged

2117
01:52:31,209 --> 01:52:32,640
it does land and buildings 5%

2118
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,390
because automatically in my head

2119
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:36,770
I'm thinking land has never depreciation.

2120
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:40,469
So and you say the key piece here is in this sentence

2121
01:52:40,469 --> 01:52:43,580
here lands and buildings per the trial balance

2122
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:46,930
includes non- depreciable land of 500,000.

2123
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:50,419
So that's where it's telling me that I don't appreciate

2124
01:52:50,419 --> 01:52:52,640
it by that 500,000,

2125
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,230
isn't going to have depreciation on it,

2126
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:56,709
but I can understand, hey that would cause a little bit

2127
01:52:56,709 --> 01:52:58,879
of confusion there because it just say quite

2128
01:52:58,879 --> 01:53:00,950
clearly land and buildings is 5%.

2129
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:04,627
So hopefully that clears that up (indistinct).

2130
01:53:04,627 --> 01:53:07,276
Anything else?

2131
01:53:07,459 --> 01:53:09,150
If you have any questions,

2132
01:53:09,150 --> 01:53:12,450
I am monitoring the session for interim assessment piece.

2133
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:14,307
So if you put questions there, I'm trying to get back...

2134
01:53:14,307 --> 01:53:17,290
Oop sorry, I just pulled my ear (indistinct).

2135
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:20,790
I am trying to get back to them as quickly as possible,

2136
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:22,509
rather than leaving it hanging over,

2137
01:53:22,509 --> 01:53:23,950
but do have a...

2138
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:25,680
Take a moment to try and work out

2139
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:28,160
what it is because you worked through

2140
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,067
it kind of is a bit easier,

2141
01:53:30,067 --> 01:53:31,067
but sometimes you just get frustrated

2142
01:53:31,067 --> 01:53:33,990
and you can't really see where the figure is coming from.

2143
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:36,177
But so the discussion forum,

2144
01:53:36,177 --> 01:53:38,009
I am checking over the next while.

2145
01:53:38,009 --> 01:53:39,650
So the exam is already January,

2146
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:41,759
so I'm looking forward to hectic Christmas time

2147
01:53:41,759 --> 01:53:45,504
answering queries, but is there anything else?

2148
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:50,259
We've all given up.

2149
01:53:50,259 --> 01:53:52,570
Again, I just can't apologize enough for all the messing

2150
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:56,020
around and it shouldn't have happened, but I don't know.

2151
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:57,664
I have used all this before and I've never had an issue.

2152
01:53:57,664 --> 01:53:59,892
So unless I've forgotten how to do everything, I doubt,

2153
01:53:59,892 --> 01:54:01,253
I dunno there's some quickie going on.

2154
01:54:01,253 --> 01:54:05,133
I usually have no problem sharing anything like this.

2155
01:54:05,561 --> 01:54:08,620
So thanks so much, very best luck

2156
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:10,999
in the assessment work through the sample papers

2157
01:54:10,999 --> 01:54:13,339
and make sure that you do try those ones

2158
01:54:13,339 --> 01:54:15,549
and any questions at all.

2159
01:54:15,549 --> 01:54:18,249
Please use the discussion forum

2160
01:54:18,249 --> 01:54:20,093
and then we'll try and get back to you.

2161
01:54:20,093 --> 01:54:21,150
Thanks very much.

2162
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:22,799
Happy Christmas, have a lovely Christmas.

2163
01:54:22,799 --> 01:54:25,690
It feels like Christmas is going to fall upon us.

2164
01:54:25,690 --> 01:54:27,049
It seems that we landed with this company for in December,

2165
01:54:27,049 --> 01:54:30,966
but very best to look and happy to answer any questions

2166
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:32,709
that you may have.

2167
01:54:32,709 --> 01:54:33,810
Have a lovely evening.

2168
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:36,173
Take care.

2169
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:52,055
Oops, let me switch that up.

2170
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:53,110
Do you...

2171
01:54:53,110 --> 01:54:56,594
Are you closing the session own or?

2172
01:54:57,549 --> 01:55:00,009
- [Man] Yeah I think I can end it here now.

2173
01:55:00,009 --> 01:55:01,039
- [Instructor] Okay, perfect.

2174
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:02,039
Listen, thanks a million.

2175
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:03,860
I don't know what was going on with that.

2176
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:06,490
It was very bizarre.

2177
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:08,400
- [Man] Yeah I'm not quite sure either.

2178
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,499
- [Instructor] So was there a spreadsheet

2179
01:55:09,499 --> 01:55:10,499
or some shown up there?

2180
01:55:10,499 --> 01:55:11,499
There shouldn't have been a spreadsheet.

2181
01:55:11,499 --> 01:55:15,343
Didn't think I had an open (indistinct) everything.

2182
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:18,440
- [Man] I'm not quite sure what it was.

2183
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,160
- [Instructor] Okay, so I might ask them not to put

2184
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,390
that record because I don't know what was going on there.

2185
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:24,629
It's a bit choppy.

2186
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:25,629
Thanks a million for everything.

2187
01:55:25,629 --> 01:55:27,123
Take care.

2188
01:55:27,123 --> 01:55:28,123
- [Man] Thank you.

2189
01:55:28,123 --> 01:55:29,123
Thanks.

2190
01:55:29,123 --> 01:55:32,043
- [Instructor] Bye.
