00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,020
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,120
My name is Chris styles and I have the great

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,220

and special guests to the second, meet the CEO for 2021.

6
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,830
Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge the

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,420
biblical people that are the traditional

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,790
custodians of the land on which I am speaking from.

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,400
I also acknowledge the traditional owners of the

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,980
lands on which we made across the country and pay

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,140
our respects to their elders past and present.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,480
And I extend that respect to all Aboriginal and

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,820
Torres Strait Islanders who are part of the units.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,210
WQ.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,559
We have once again, adopted a virtual format for me to

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,709
CEO, which allows us to include alumni and other members

17
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,679
of the UNFW network across Australia and globally.

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,080
But I can assure you that we will be returning

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,810
to some live events in 2022 while keeping in

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,600
mind the huge reach that digital formats allow.

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,720
So a warm welcome to the large number of you

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,729
who are joining us wherever you are across.

23
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:21,345

00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:39,255

38
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,590
Several themes emerged around leadership, innovation

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,020
and responsible management, and we've incorporated

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,000

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,710
thank you for joining us for this.

50
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,030
Meet the CEO.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,570
I'm told that the meet the CEO has been

52
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,470
going for 19 years, and this is the 40.

53
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,220
Version of it.

54
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,350
It's sad that we can't meet in an actual physical sense, but

55
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,830
I think this virtual production will beat just marvelous.

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,560
I welcome you all, but I must tell you,

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,230
I've been thinking a lot about meet the CEO.

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,970
Why is it so successful?

59
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,420
And I think the reason really is that

60
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,850
it actually does two things for us.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,020
First.

62
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,310
It is informative.

63
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,170
And second, in my opinion, incredibly.

64
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,390
It's informative in the sense that we get the top,

65
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,380
people telling us the do's and don'ts of business, the

66
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,959
things they've done wrong and the things they've done.

67
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,470
Right.

68
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,730
Interesting.

69
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,760
Because our good interviewers get behind the

70
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,880
scenes and find out what drove these people.

71
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,149
What made them the success as they are today?

72
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,359
I can honestly say, I believe today.

73
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,739
We're in for a great.

74
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,895
I know our guests, Kelly bear Rosmarin.

75
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,695
I have worked with her for many

76
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,365
years and she's an absolute star.

77
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:53,085
I think you'll find it incredibly interesting as

78
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:57,465
someone who was appointed to be CEO of Optus on

79
00:03:57,465 --> 00:04:02,775
the 1st of April, 2020, she saw the COVID pandemic

80
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:05,775
from start right through to where we are today.

81
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,050
And I'm sure she'll give us some views on how she managed.

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,270
She's been involved with innovation.

83
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,900
She's been involved in leadership with big companies.

84
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,769
Indeed.

85
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,960
I'm looking forward to all her

86
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,990
pointers on how she does her job.

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,960
And indeed got to be where she is prior to joining Optus.

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,159
Welcome Kelly.

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,469
Thank you so much and welcome to Optus.

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,190
Thank you.

145
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,630
Um, first I'll start with a

146
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,609
brief background on meet the CEO.

147
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:09,930
This is the 48th.

148
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,729
Meet the CEO conversation hosted

149
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,140
by you and SW business school.

150
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,240
The very first meeting the CEO guest

151
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,549
was to Richard Branson in 2003.

152
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,110
Kelly Bayer Rosmarin is the first CEO from Optus to join us.

153
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,960
Although Kong, who was the CEO of Singtel up

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,690
until last year, joined us in March, 2009.

155
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:31,777
Kelly stepped into the CEO role at Optus on 1st

156
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,965
of April, 2020, almost exactly at the time when

157
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,705
new south Wales went into its first lockdown.

158
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:40,005
So Kelly certainly knows how to zoom through a crowd, but

159
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:43,155
with restrictions lifted, I'm able to be here with Kelly.

160
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:44,745
So we've decided we can do this

161
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,215
to meet the CEO a bit differently.

162
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:49,305
I joined Kelly adopters headquarters at Macquarie

163
00:08:49,305 --> 00:08:51,375
park today, making this the first meet the

164
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,895
CEO conversation at the workplace of our seat.

165
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,120
I had the opportunity to catch up with Kelly prior

166
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,030
to today's conversation and learn that Kelly was born

167
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,090
in South Africa and lived and work in Silicon valley

168
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,430
before marrying an Australian and deciding there

169
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,400
Sydney could be home as well as being a capable and

170
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,830
highly respected business leader with a brilliant

171
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,840
reputation for being an innovative disruptor.

172
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,270
I love that Kelly is a mother and commit

173
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,920
to a significant chunk of her time to

174
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,080
contributing to the community via charitable.

175
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:23,444

179
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,875
her work in a few different organizations from a

180
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,844
Silicon valley startup to one of our four major banks.

181
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:39,645
So I'd like to start there.

182
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,714
What did you learn in those previous roles

183
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,974
that has prepared you for your current.

184
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,600
That's a huge question.

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,940
Cause I feel like you learn something every

186
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,400
day and from every person you interact with

187
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,410
and most of the best learnings just become

188
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,170
part of who you are and what you adopt.

189
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,960
But I think I might share maybe a few formative

190
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,840
experiences that might be relevant to the audience.

191
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,500
Please do.

192
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Um, one of the things I learned was to always question

193
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,190
the status quo and not to be afraid to speak up

194
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,560
when you do discover something that needs to be.

195
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,465
And I think that was probably shaped by one of my

196
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,825
first roles, uh, where I walked into a room and

197
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,165
everybody was discussing something and they were

198
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:23,045
all heading down a certain direction that I thought

199
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,625
really wasn't going to resonate with customers.

200
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,175
And so partway through the meeting, I turned to

201
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:30,575
some person who was dominating the conversation

202
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:32,525
and said, look, I don't think I agree with that.

203
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,775
Here's all the reasons why I don't think that.

204
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,005
Resonate.

205
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:39,725
Um, and after the meeting ended, everyone was like, wow,

206
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:42,485
I can't believe you would speak to the CEO that way.

207
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:45,815
Of course, I didn't know that he was the CEO at the

208
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:49,985
time, which meant I felt fine voicing my opinion and

209
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:52,025
probably to everyone else who didn't know, they didn't

210
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,625
want to stand up to that person or voice account of view.

211
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,905
But the fact that I'd been able to do that

212
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,845
successfully, I think helped shape a real lack of.

213
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Well, you could say a disrespect for authority that

214
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,250
has been quite characteristic throughout my career, and

215
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,760
also makes me in this position, want to hear from other

216
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,450
people and be open to voices no matter how junior, cause

217
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,700
you never know where the best insights can come from.

218
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,300
Yeah.

219
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,690
And so why did you move to a telco?

220
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,250
I mean, you you've had this great

221
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,690
experience, varied experience.

222
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,530
What was the uterine.

223
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,695
Well, I loved my time in banking.

224
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:31,335
I loved my time in tech in Silicon valley,

225
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,095
uh, but I'm always looking for a challenge and

226
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,705
the telco industry is incredibly challenging.

227
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,615
Um, it's one of those industries that

228
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,945
people rely on so much use frequently.

229
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,530
Um, it's really important to people.

230
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,910
Um, and yet the industry itself has been, uh,

231
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,450
reducing in value over time with declining rakes

232
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,050
in the industry and becoming almost relegated to a

233
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,450
background service that people don't think about.

234
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,410
So that looked like an unsatisfactory state of affairs.

235
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,690
And the more I looked at the telco industry,

236
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,940
the more it seemed that it was right before.

237
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,395
Innovation or fresh thinking, uh, to restore it

238
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:16,094
to its rightful place, which should be really

239
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,515
glory days as everybody is relying on their

240
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:22,214
phones and really using the connectivity that

241
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:24,494
we provide and for which there is no substitute.

242
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:25,545
Yeah, absolutely.

243
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,405
So is it the challenge that attacks?

244
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:27,795
Yes.

245
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,234
And you obviously love a challenge, but

246
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,064
it wasn't just a challenging sector.

247
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,204
It's a challenging time.

248
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,334
So you walked into this challenging

249
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,494
sector at the most challenging time.

250
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:37,935
Of all.

251
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:39,495
And how have you coped with that?

252
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:40,905
Well, obviously I couldn't have

253
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:43,095
predicted that nobody could have.

254
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:45,885
Um, and, and it was, it was difficult.

255
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:49,395
I think, um, I had the privilege of coming

256
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,825
in as the deputy CEO first, so that I got

257
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,925
a period of time to learn the industry.

258
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:58,305
Uh, to formulate a strategy to be really ready to go.

259
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:01,815
So we had pretty much planned the perfect first

260
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,935
day as CEO, the perfect rollout of the strategy,

261
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,695
uh, visiting all the teams around the country.

262
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,125
I mean, it was the most beautiful plan you've ever seen.

263
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:13,095
And then we had to throw the entire plan

264
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:16,155
out the window, uh, and pivot entirely.

265
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,345
And I spent my first day at home.

266
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,445
Um, so I, I.

267
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,810
You always have to be ready for the unexpected.

268
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,850
It's a bit of a cliche, but you have to be

269
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,880
willing to adapt, to listen to advice from others

270
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,950
and then see the good that comes from that.

271
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,240
So some of what we pivoted to, uh, in those early days was,

272
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,620
uh, we actually introduced a series, uh, on the strategy.

273
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,450
It was a weekly series.

274
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,160
So the whole company eagerly

275
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
anticipated every mixed episode.

276
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,440
And we got to explain the series and record it really well.

277
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,875
Professionally produced by the Optus sport team

278
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,244
who didn't have football to broadcast at the time.

279
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:58,364
And now we have this awesome series that all the

280
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:01,035
new starters can watch and that people can rewatch.

281
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:02,265
If they need a refresher on the

282
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:04,755
strategy, we would have never had that.

283
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:08,444
Had we not made the pivot and it's proved to be very useful.

284
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:12,344
So it was a challenging time, uh, but also a time

285
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,765
that really enabled us to make some good points.

286
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,090
And to galvanize the team together.

287
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,420
Yeah.

288
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,010
So you didn't waste a good crisis then?

289
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,830
No, Def definitely not.

290
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,350
Um, it really helped us also accelerate some of the

291
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,930
things we wanted to do because it removed some of

292
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,630
the barriers and excuses around change management.

293
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,720
So a good example, there is we had in our three-year

294
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,540
plan that we were going to change our whole call center.

295
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:39,975
To be one that was much more customer centric.

296
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:43,395
Um, in the old model, if a customer called in

297
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:45,825
would transfer them from department to department.

298
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,835
Oh no, that sounds like a billing inquiry.

299
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,365
Let me transfer it to the billing team.

300
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,465
Oh no, no, that actually sounds

301
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:53,135
like it's a problem with coverage.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,590
Uh, transfer you to another team.

303
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,650
And we wanted to move to a team of experts model,

304
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,800
where there was a team with all the skills that were

305
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,260
needed to answer your question on the first call.

306
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,630
So that was in our three year plan.

307
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,190
And then what happened in the

308
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,580
middle of COVID is that we actually.

309
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,949
90% of our coal Sante capacity, because we had simultaneous

310
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,920
shutdowns across Australia, the Philippines and India.

311
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,130
So despite a very diversified strategy, we lost

312
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,750
all of that, um, access to our teams and, um, yeah.

313
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,270
Sometimes when I say that people think will come

314
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,370
executive just coming on the weekend and answer a

315
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,270
few calls, but, but we get, uh, 400,000 calls a week.

316
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,760
So when you lose 90% of your capacity

317
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,200
to answer that that's a lot of calls.

318
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,180
That's a lot of customers at the moment.

319
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,090
They need their connectivity, most ringing us for help.

320
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,070
So we had to be very creative in

321
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,390
how we pivoted to get through.

322
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,130
And a lot of that involves us taking the teams

323
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,500
we had and cross training them on new things.

324
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,720
And so people who used to be in that billing team

325
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,750
went out, answering all sorts of questions and we

326
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,570
decided wouldn't it be a pity to let everybody, as

327
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,590
soon as the crisis abated, after a few weeks, Go

328
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,530
back into their old teams and back to their old ways.

329
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,050
Everybody was so invigorated by learning new

330
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,390
skills and taking on new responsibilities.

331
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,120
We decided to really accelerate that push and move

332
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,570
straight into a team of experts model and really

333
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,660
bring forward that change by multiple years.

334
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,020
So I think it always is good to understand

335
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,900
that a crisis presents major challenges.

336
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,225
But also some huge opportunities.

337
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:29,855
Absolutely.

338
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,745
And I think it's a type of leadership or a

339
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:34,565
style of leadership that enables that change.

340
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,545
And, you know, you've, you've clearly moved

341
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:39,305
Optus to, and far more agile organization

342
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:40,925
in the 18 months of your leadership.

343
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,415
Uh, what do you think it is about your leadership

344
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:46,955
that has, that enables change to happen so fast?

345
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,905
Because not every leader is open to

346
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,825
change in the way that you've described.

347
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,915
I think it's, it's a lot of things.

348
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,595
I think it starts with.

349
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,400
I'm fairly clear understanding for me that

350
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,050
everything good that's going to happen at

351
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,870
Apttus is going to happen because of our people.

352
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,319
Yeah.

353
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,379
So, you know, some people think of the telco assets

354
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:10,260
as the network, and that is absolutely true, but

355
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,109
fundamentally our most important asset is our people.

356
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,020
And I know of how people have a great

357
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,849
vision that they're inspired by.

358
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,599
They have all the tools and support to achieve that.

359
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:24,885
A good strategy, real clarity on what they need to do, and

360
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,795
then the empowerment to actually go and make that happen.

361
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,655
We're going to get great outcomes.

362
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:33,045
So, uh, I definitely bring a strong focus on people

363
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:36,105
and a lot of what I've focused my time and energy

364
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,764
on in the last 18 months is the people agenda the

365
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:43,455
culture, the behaviors we want to see, um, and

366
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,065
listening and bringing out the voices of our very.

367
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,610
Workforce.

368
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,530
So I think that's definitely an

369
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,380
element, but then also I love ideas.

370
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,170
I just naturally gravitate towards ideas.

371
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,580
I encourage ideas and I do push the teams very hard.

372
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,890
And I think that it enables us

373
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,750
to work in a, in a different way.

374
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,340
And we have been delivering some

375
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,410
amazing innovation for our customers.

376
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,470
Um, but also every strength also is a way.

377
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:14,835
So I, I'm definitely very acutely aware that I'm pushing

378
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:18,495
the organization very hard and it is taking strain.

379
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,985
Like people are working very hard.

380
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:24,735
They're tired with rolling out a lot of things, and

381
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,225
there's a big ambitious agenda of more things to happen.

382
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:28,875
So that does put a certain amount

383
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,375
of strain on the organization.

384
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,024
And so I also need to have people

385
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:34,605
around me who say enough is enough.

386
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:35,925
You're going too hard.

387
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:36,075
You got.

388
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,590
Too fast.

389
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,330
You need to give people time to catch up.

390
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,370
Well, you must be doing something, right,

391
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,620
because I've learned that since you became CEO

392
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,810
engagement has gone up significantly adopters.

393
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,629
Um, your engagement score actually went up 11%.

394
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,850
Um, so what's the secret.

395
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,290
I know that you value people.

396
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,030
It's very clear that you value people.

397
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,220
Um, but not everybody that values people

398
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,629
hasn't engaged with school like that.

399
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,420
Um, what do you think is unique to.

400
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,889
Yeah, I think for us, it's about engaging the

401
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,949
whole team in our own cultural transformation.

402
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:11,699
So you can appreciate people, but are you willing to put the

403
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:15,600
time and energy into actually changing people's behaviors?

404
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:16,470
That's very hard.

405
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,459
It's quite daunting.

406
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,290
So we've done a number of things.

407
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,929
I mean, um, we actually defined,

408
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,270
uh, a purpose for the company.

409
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,679
Um, it, our purpose is to power optimism with.

410
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:31,455
Um, and that really allows our

411
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,245
people to unite behind a common goal.

412
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:38,324
We also then defined the eight cultural attributes.

413
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:41,445
We were going to aspire to four of those attributes

414
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:43,425
were things we already did well strengths.

415
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,375
We wanted to amplify and strengthen.

416
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:48,615
And four of them were ways in which we

417
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:50,475
thought we could be better in the future.

418
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:54,104
And then for each of those eight cultural attributes, we

419
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:57,344
defined a behavior that people could put into practice.

420
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,155
To live up to that cultural value.

421
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:02,465
So that was all very structured.

422
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:07,115
We then brought in PWC to do a big culture audit of what

423
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:09,695
is the current culture and where are the gaps between

424
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,945
the current culture and the one we're trying to build.

425
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:13,925
And then we had introduce a range

426
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:16,115
of, of real interventions to get.

427
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,580
So interventions, for example, rolling out the

428
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,610
behaviors with training and reinforcing them.

429
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,100
And now the intervention was aligning all

430
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,710
of our KPIs to our vision and strategy.

431
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,120
Um, another intervention was introducing, um,

432
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,840
development week where people could focus on their own

433
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,560
development, a lot of training, uh, learning Fiesta

434
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,990
that went around all the training we wanted people

435
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,490
to do, and a KPI that we have now for everybody to.

436
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,350
12 hours of their own learning in a year.

437
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,430
So, um, a lot of different interventions to actually show

438
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,400
that you're serious, you care about people and you're

439
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,040
willing to put in the effort and the organizational for.

440
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,950
To make that come to fruition and

441
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,120
you're really passionate about culture.

442
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,320
I can, I can hear it.

443
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,780
Uh, and I honestly wish I'd worked here

444
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,520
because that would be, that sounds fantastic.

445
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,010
Um, what is it about culture?

446
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,190
That's so important for a telco and, uh, and I guess

447
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,990
for innovation, what, why do you think it matters

448
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,450
so much and how much of a difference can it make?

449
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,390
Yeah, um, it, it makes all the difference

450
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,140
because actually in my experience, in any

451
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,960
group, there are any group of any size.

452
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,950
There are people who have.

453
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,880
Strong views or inclinations about what's not

454
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,980
going so well and what could be done differently

455
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,770
to make it better, but often the culture can

456
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,260
suppress that or make people not voice it.

457
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,690
So they'd rather, you know, get together in

458
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,480
small groups and complain about it, then actually

459
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,030
act on it and do something proactive about it.

460
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,120
So, uh, in my view, if you can get the culture right,

461
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,850
then you actually have everybody's complaints and ideas.

462
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,360
Constructively channeled to making improvements

463
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
that they make a difference for customers,

464
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,440
colleagues, and ultimately shareholders.

465
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,030
So, so one part of the, the culture program and,

466
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,620
and our priority, which is called amazing people.

467
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,240
So one of our.

468
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,190
Uh, strategic pillars.

469
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,030
Um, one aspect of that is innovation mindset.

470
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,340
And that's also about training people to look for

471
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,160
innovation, to be comfortable, voicing it, to have

472
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,129
a culture of experimentation, uh, to know that

473
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:25,260
we're funding, new ideas that we're willing to.

474
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:28,015
Tri world first innovation.

475
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:31,255
Um, and I think if you instill that idea that we're,

476
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:33,985
open-minded, we're willing to do things in new way.

477
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:36,805
We've want people to speak up and voice their ideas.

478
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:39,385
We'll actually fund some of those initiatives.

479
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:43,075
We'll bring in engaging speakers from outside the industry.

480
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:47,310
Uh, Uh, inside the industry, but from other markets and

481
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,330
we'll help people stimulate those ideas that all creates

482
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,230
a culture that enables ideas to flourish and people to

483
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,940
feel comfortable being themselves, being open and sharing

484
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,060
their best ideas and discretionary effort with the company.

485
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,260
Sounds fantastic.

486
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,650
Um, as a customer, what would I see if I'm, if

487
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,040
I'm looking at Optus now, um, since you've come

488
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,020
in as a CEO, what changes have you made for.

489
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:16,455
Well, if you're a customer, hopefully you would

490
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:20,325
see fantastic plans that give you more choices

491
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,425
than any other plan in the market about what you

492
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:24,825
want to Inc include and exclude in your plan.

493
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:28,605
Um, hopefully you would see some amazing features

494
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:31,425
that you would not actually see at any telco globally,

495
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:35,785
for example, uh, Optus pores, which would let you.

496
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:41,355
Simultaneously pause and restart any or all of your

497
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:46,094
devices, whether that's mobile or connected to your wifi.

498
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,905
Um, and what that means is if you wanted to have

499
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,935
a really important family dinner and you did

500
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:55,725
not want your kids, uh, getting their Snapchat

501
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:59,355
notifications, Or, or your kids didn't want you being

502
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,085
distracted by all those work texts coming through.

503
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:04,665
You could just put the whole family on poles.

504
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:05,625
Fantastic.

505
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:07,754
Or if you had a son who was really into

506
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:09,835
gaming and wouldn't come to the table and.

507
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,439
You can pose just his computer for the next hour

508
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,629
and make sure that he joined you at the table.

509
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,879
Um, so some of our customers use

510
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:19,709
it as a bit of a digital detox.

511
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,750
We even have customers who use it when

512
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,820
they've got an important work call, they shut

513
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,770
everybody else off in the family so that the

514
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,830
full strength of wifi is prioritized to them.

515
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,439
Um, but it's, those sorts of features, features that

516
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:34,110
are part of our living network that are very unique.

517
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,639
They're designed to help customers

518
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:36,810
in the moments that matter.

519
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,020
And so hopefully customers will say that and then.

520
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,580
Um, not finally.

521
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,800
I mean, customers should see the fastest five.

522
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:47,865
Uh, they should also see improved service when they call

523
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:51,405
in improved service options, like messaging from inside our

524
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:54,405
app, uh, and more and more self-service that's out there.

525
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:56,445
So that's a lot to have achieved in 18 months.

526
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:56,775
Kelly.

527
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:57,675
That's fantastic.

528
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,685
I did say I pushed the teams really

529
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:01,665
hard and we're doing a lot at pace.

530
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,490
It's something we're serious about, but it's also

531
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,680
invigorating for our people because they can see

532
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,690
that we're making a difference for customers.

533
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,970
And one of the things I love

534
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,920
about Optus is really our people.

535
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,250
We have great people working here and they do truly

536
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,860
care about giving our customers a great experience.

537
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,220
So helping channel that in this way, um,

538
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,020
is very rewarding for the whole team.

539
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,790
So now I'm going to ask you a question about.

540
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:29,855
Some of your people, um, because one of the

541
00:25:29,855 --> 00:25:32,645
challenges that many businesses face is losing

542
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:36,034
talented women when they start a family and

543
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,745
you've been through this, you've started a family.

544
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,865
And how did you personally manage these period in your life

545
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:43,804
and how does Optus continue to engage women so that they can

546
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:46,264
come back and continue their brilliant careers with Optus?

547
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:47,524
Yeah.

548
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:49,655
So, um, two great questions in there.

549
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:53,794
I think, um, in terms of Optus, uh, attracting.

550
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:57,195
Female talent is a high priority for us.

551
00:25:57,525 --> 00:26:00,615
I think in, in an area where we have a lot of

552
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:04,695
engineering talent and not just engineering talent in

553
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:08,205
the view of sort of software and, and the common talent

554
00:26:08,595 --> 00:26:11,115
that, that everybody in the market is competing for.

555
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:14,325
But we also need specialized skills, network, talent,

556
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:17,475
astrophysicists for our satellite business, et cetera.

557
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:19,725
So, um, we're very focused on

558
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,525
recruiting, nurturing, and growing.

559
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,780
Uh, female talent at, at Optus.

560
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,590
Um, and again, we have a number of specific programs

561
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,960
that we're putting in place, whether it's mentoring the

562
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,020
senior women, uh, whether it's programs to help them

563
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,280
with development planning, um, or whether it's actually

564
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,860
sort of putting, um, clear goals on the table with our

565
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,040
recruitment targets when it comes to women in stem.

566
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,250
Um, so all of those were in place and of course we have to

567
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,520
have good policies for maternity leave, continuous learning.

568
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,955
It et cetera, which are all there and in place.

569
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:59,324
Um, for me personally, I think, um, having a family

570
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:02,085
is a wonderful thing, a wonderful thing to do.

571
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:04,725
Uh, I always knew that I wanted to

572
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,215
work full time even when I had kids.

573
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:11,054
And so, um, I just tried to set up my

574
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:13,544
circumstances in a way that would allow that.

575
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:17,745
Happen, without feeling I was compromising on either front.

576
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:21,584
Um, so for me, that involved outsourcing as much

577
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:24,435
as I possibly could of the things I don't enjoy,

578
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:27,044
whether that's shopping, there were a whole number

579
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:29,354
of years say I didn't even shop for my own clothes.

580
00:27:29,354 --> 00:27:31,364
I was like, I'm not wasting time in a shopping

581
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:34,635
center looking for clothes, any spare moment I have,

582
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,675
I'm going to spend with my kids on the weekend.

583
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:40,094
Um, and it made for me having a full-time Manny.

584
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,774
So I didn't have to worry about.

585
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,270
Maybe to leave early or something was happening.

586
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,660
And then I always had a backup plan because I think

587
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,200
that's where some people also get stressed situations.

588
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,140
Cause invariably the day that your plan a like

589
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,390
the kid's sick or the nanny is sick, that's

590
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,550
also the day you have a huge presentation.

591
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,410
And so does your husband, so it's

592
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,270
always good to have a backup plan.

593
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,150
Um, and so I put all of that in place to make it

594
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,440
possible for me to focus on my career and being a good.

595
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:14,695
Um, and what I normally tell a young woman who

596
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:17,125
are looking for advice is that there's no formula.

597
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:19,254
It actually starts with understanding.

598
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:22,225
What's going to make you satisfied and then setting up your

599
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:25,315
circumstances in a way that enables you to achieve that.

600
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:28,405
And for some people that might mean working part-time

601
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:31,525
and being home with their kids some days, um, and for

602
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:34,615
others, it might be half days or job sharing for others.

603
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:36,445
It might be taking a year off and

604
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:38,185
staying home or whatever it is.

605
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,835
But the, the real challenge for most people is

606
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:45,045
asking the tough questions of what they truly

607
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:47,865
want and then having the courage to create

608
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:49,905
the circumstances that allow them to achieve.

609
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:51,495
Yeah, no, I completely agree.

610
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:55,185
And I did very much what you did and, um, and my

611
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:57,645
children are now in their twenties and they are fine.

612
00:28:58,065 --> 00:28:59,925
So it's, you know, we can do this.

613
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:03,105
I'm sure they're better than I know a proud mom.

614
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:07,335
Um, so Kelly, we have a few questions we'd like to ask them.

615
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:09,135
That have tuned in today.

616
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,745
Uh, the first is what is the most important

617
00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:13,695
leadership skill for the future and why?

618
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:17,595
I think I would say humility.

619
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:22,005
Um, the reason I say humility is that you have

620
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:24,315
to be able to recognize when you don't have the.

621
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,360
There's a strong pressure when you're in a leadership

622
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,990
role to act and to have all the answers and the

623
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,330
minute you think, you know everything and can't

624
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,900
admit you don't, it makes you closed off to ideas.

625
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,240
So I think humility is the key to

626
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,730
learning, to openness, to new ideas.

627
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,390
And to invite in contribution from others in the team.

628
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,930
And I think the more complex problems get

629
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,360
the more foolish it would be to think that

630
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,700
any one person can have all the answers.

631
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,300
So I think that's the key attribute moving forward.

632
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:57,660
Yeah.

633
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,440
Great answer.

634
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,290
Uh, the second question is how important is it for

635
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,470
enterprises to build, to help build resilience,

636
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,390
to change and disruption within their employees?

637
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,320
I do think that is important.

638
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,990
I also think that given the circumstances, we've all

639
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,230
just lived through, we don't actually need to invent

640
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,020
new challenges to throw it, throw to our people.

641
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:22,440
I think it's been a very sort of natural time of

642
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,500
people growing in their resilience and adaptability.

643
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,500
And so I think, uh, our job is just to leverage that.

644
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:31,665
Uh, almost like plasticine and make sure

645
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,185
it stretches into the workplace as well.

646
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:38,115
And we don't just snap back into bed, bad habits or make

647
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:41,085
all of the learning be on the personal side for people.

648
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:41,625
Yeah.

649
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,375
What do you see is the next big innovation

650
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,774
in telecommunication and how do you at Optus

651
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:49,845
make sure the business is relevant and evolve.

652
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:56,595
I mean, obviously we at Apttus feel that, uh, we're building

653
00:30:56,595 --> 00:31:00,255
the next big thing, which is the living network and where

654
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:02,955
that really came from is this idea that at the moment,

655
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:07,485
telco services are seen as a one size fits all utility.

656
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:09,945
You choose your plan for the month and then

657
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:12,315
you set it up and you've got that amount

658
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:15,225
of data every month from now until forever.

659
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:17,865
And you only think about it when you get your.

660
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,939
And actually, we don't think that

661
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,010
connectivity needs to be that way.

662
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,070
We think it's something you can dial up on the day

663
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,889
that you wanted and get an unlimited day-to-day or a

664
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:32,250
speed boost if you need to or switch it off completely.

665
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,780
Like I described before.

666
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,040
Um, if you want a digital detox day, um, we think you should

667
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,919
be able to use your connectivity in a way that actually

668
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,520
suits your needs and adds to your whole experience on the.

669
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,210
And so we've got a range of really great

670
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,250
features that we're rolling out as part of

671
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,800
making the network come alive in your fingertips.

672
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,350
They're all accessible from within our app.

673
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,500
So at your fingertips, they look really, really simple.

674
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:59,930
And we think that that will transform how people

675
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,320
think of their connectivity, um, to something they can

676
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,070
actually control, influence use, and that will provide,

677
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,940
um, more richness to their lives in the moments that.

678
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,000
Great.

679
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,020
Um, so question about the employment engagement level.

680
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,630
Um, the question is what was the employment

681
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,610
engagement level at Optus pre COVID?

682
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,040
Um, and how does this compare to your projected

683
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,870
employment engagement levels and five years?

684
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,070
So we talked about the growth, but we

685
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,130
didn't talk about what the COVID impact.

686
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,430
Yeah.

687
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,660
Um, look, it it's really difficult to

688
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,450
answer what the COVID impact is going to be.

689
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,930
Um, I think, cause it's been in multiple stages,

690
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,850
I think, uh, last year, COVID probably had a

691
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,080
slightly positive impact on our employee engagement.

692
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,850
I think all the initiatives we did had a huge

693
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,350
impact, but I think it was also partly, uh, the

694
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:59,129
nature of, of, of the work that we do here at Optus

695
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:02,520
being so purposeful and relevant in a pandemic.

696
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,950
I mean, suddenly everybody was relying on our

697
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,350
services to work from home school, from home.

698
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:10,695
Connect to their loved ones, excess the content they

699
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:15,585
wanted to without the internet, without access to your

700
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:19,125
phone and, and all the data that we provide, uh, people

701
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,735
wouldn't have been able to cope through the pandemic.

702
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,475
So there was a huge sense of purpose

703
00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:25,215
that I think gave an uplift here.

704
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,435
And I think also everything we did to

705
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:29,985
support our employees, their mental wellness,

706
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:33,045
launching up the sport fitness, which was free.

707
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,540
Classes for all of our customers and our people.

708
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,120
I think all of that made a big difference and

709
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,640
gave us the opportunity to demonstrate even

710
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,680
more clearly how much we care for our people.

711
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,440
I think this year, it might be a bit different.

712
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,820
We've just launched our employee

713
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,010
survey after four months of lockdown.

714
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,110
Um, and in Melbourne many more.

715
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,910
I mean, Melbourne is the city with the

716
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,520
most lockdown days of any city globally.

717
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,920
And I think there are people out there who are just

718
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,725
generally a bit depressed and, um, Not really loving life.

719
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:05,760
Yeah.

720
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,810
I don't know how that's going to affect employee engagement.

721
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,380
My hope is that if it does affect it, it's a temporary

722
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:16,500
aberration and our nice sort of upward trajectory.

723
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,720
But I think we'd be crazy to assume

724
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,580
that the generals like Geist out there.

725
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,600
It doesn't have an impact.

726
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,970
We're just a microcosm of society.

727
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,420
Um, and, uh, I do think there's been a little

728
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,340
bit of a dampening of people's spirits.

729
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,980
Through the lockdowns as is understandable.

730
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,409
Yeah.

731
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,779
We're doing everything we can to

732
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,070
support our people through it.

733
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:38,850
I mean, including, we landed up, um, sending UDIs

734
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,659
to every Optus employee, uh, and that's because

735
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,330
I wanted to give everybody a hug during the

736
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,000
lockdown and, uh, we kept challenging the team.

737
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,740
What's going to feel like a nice warm hug.

738
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,960
And they came up with the idea of hoodies.

739
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,030
And so we sent one to every person.

740
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,000
Um, and then of course all the other

741
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,680
more traditional forms of support.

742
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,290
So hopefully that's made a difference, but

743
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,960
we, we definitely recognize that the general

744
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,390
sentiment out there is gonna affect engagement.

745
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:07,660
Yeah.

746
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,070
Look, and there's no doubt that when people

747
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,190
feel cared for that, they're going to.

748
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,690
Happier and more positive about the work that they're doing.

749
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,240
So, um, you know, good on you for doing that.

750
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,280
I think that's, that's brilliant for your people.

751
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,890
Um, the last question from those

752
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,320
tuning in today is about AI.

753
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,120
So what is your perspective on AI

754
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,400
and use of robotics in the workplace?

755
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,070
And does Optus have a plan for automate automation of.

756
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:37,395
Yeah, it's a great question because, um, I think AI

757
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:39,495
and robotics, I mean, there's a whole spectrum and we

758
00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:41,715
could probably have a two hour conversation on this.

759
00:35:42,135 --> 00:35:45,465
Um, they're, they're obviously all, um, very important

760
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:48,795
and have a role to play in the Apttus of the future.

761
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:53,205
So, um, when it comes to robotics and automation, there's

762
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:55,845
a number of processes that we still do that are manual.

763
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,590
That could be automated to get a more reliable and

764
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,620
predictable result for our customers, uh, and be done

765
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,650
faster and cheaper, which also benefits our customers.

766
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,040
So, um, we do have a program where we have been

767
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,250
automating and deploying bots to do things.

768
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,300
Um, and then we also have been embracing artificial

769
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,730
intelligence and natural language processing.

770
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,180
Without Apttus assistant, which is, uh,

771
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,810
a piece of AI technology that responds to

772
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,390
customer's queries when they are in the app.

773
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,410
And they message us.

774
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,870
It's the first line of response.

775
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,020
And actually during all the lockdowns, we dial that

776
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,770
up from sort of answering 5% of questions to answering

777
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:42,399
more than 30% of people's questions on its own unaided.

778
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,339
So that's a very smart piece of technology.

779
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:46,750
It's constantly learning.

780
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,480
Every question, a customer asks makes

781
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,730
the AI smarter and more accurate.

782
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,910
Um, and that is helping us get customers, their answers

783
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,290
faster, um, without having to wait to speak to someone

784
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,810
or for someone to answer their message manually.

785
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,780
Um, and hopefully that can continue

786
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,580
to improve over time as well.

787
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,650
There's also some very interesting AI that

788
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,870
gets applied to data and passion in this.

789
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,670
That's helping us develop our

790
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,350
network plans, where we should put a.

791
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,770
Where we should make our next incremental

792
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,550
investment in our, uh, tower network, um,

793
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,520
and, uh, helping us optimize our service.

794
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:26,670
So lots of very interesting applications.

795
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,680
And I think it's almost an area where the skies.

796
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,665
And we just need more smart people asking

797
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:34,485
the right questions and then developing the

798
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,545
solutions to, to go out and solve those cases.

799
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:39,645
Yeah, that sounds very exciting.

800
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:42,015
Um, now I said that that might be the

801
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:43,635
final question, but we're not quite done.

802
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:47,355
Um, we're going to do things a bit differently.

803
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:48,915
Um, and so I have some questions for

804
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:50,865
you to answer, uh, in 30 seconds.

805
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,650
Oh, my goodness.

806
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,380
Just quick question, quick answer.

807
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,270
Um, tell us something about you that we may not know.

808
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,570
I'm pretty much an open book.

809
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,830
What you see is what you get.

810
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,730
If anything I'm too.

811
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:07,845
I dunno for those who don't know.

812
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:10,755
I had a bet with Dan Ricardo that, uh, if

813
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,055
he, if he won a race, I would do a Shui.

814
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,755
Uh, and when we all have the number one market

815
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,245
share in mobile, he's going to do a shoe for us.

816
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:21,435
So he did when Monza and I landed

817
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:23,565
up doing a Shui and people loved it.

818
00:38:23,654 --> 00:38:25,665
I thought it was kind of embarrassing and

819
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:27,705
I just emailed it to him, but then I was

820
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,315
encouraged to post it and post it into it.

821
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:30,884
So when does he do.

822
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,680
Um, hopefully soon, hopefully soon.

823
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,930
Uh, what's your favorite Optus offering?

824
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,540
So if you were a customer, what would be your favorite part?

825
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,050
I mean, it's like asking me about my favorite children.

826
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,780
So it's a little bit of Maine, but I do have a soft spot

827
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,500
for donate your data, um, which allows our customers

828
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,820
to, from within their app, donate their unused data to

829
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,790
underprivileged kids who really need that data in order to.

830
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,150
Do their homework at school and connect with their friends.

831
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,680
I think it's a beautiful offering.

832
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,060
It was very unique.

833
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,520
And so it does have it a special place.

834
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:06,450
Yeah.

835
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,610
I can understand why, um, Kelly

836
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,170
Optus is such a well-known brand.

837
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,780
Can you tell us something about Optus that we may not know?

838
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,350
Well, I think everybody knows us for our mobile

839
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,890
solutions, our connectivity, um, home internet.

840
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:22,725
Getting the latest phones.

841
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:24,765
Um, but I think what people don't know is

842
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:27,645
that we're also the preeminent provider

843
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:30,105
of satellite services in the country.

844
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,984
So we fly a fleet of satellites.

845
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:36,915
Um, we also fly NBN sky muster satellites.

846
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:41,835
Uh, we work with the department of defense and we, um,

847
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:45,585
are very proud of that capability, which was one that, um,

848
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:49,185
Optus has had for many years, uh, originally acquiring us.

849
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:52,755
And it also means that we get to hire some very unique

850
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:57,075
people and train people on, um, some capabilities that

851
00:39:57,075 --> 00:40:00,705
are really important, uh, and, and important capabilities

852
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:05,685
that need to be, uh, housed in Australia, sovereign in

853
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:08,745
Australia to make sure that in the future, we've got a

854
00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:14,505
burgeoning, um, growth area in, in satellites and space.

855
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:16,935
I think not a lot of people know

856
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:18,315
that we have that capability.

857
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:19,035
No, certainly.

858
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:19,665
I didn't know that.

859
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:24,585
How do you keep up your team's spirits during well,

860
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:27,285
actually through COVID, but also now going in, you

861
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:29,535
know, we talked about the fact that it's difficult,

862
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:31,634
what's the one thing that you think is keeping.

863
00:40:32,745 --> 00:40:33,674
Oh, the spirit.

864
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:35,174
I think that they love working

865
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:36,615
on all these innovative projects.

866
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,285
But if I was to say the real thing is investing

867
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:41,895
in the capability development of our people, I've

868
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:44,895
been very passionate about championing, um, what

869
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:47,924
we call Apttus U Apttus university, which is,

870
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:50,415
um, working with different universities to offer

871
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:53,265
micro-credentials to our people in emerging fields.

872
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,820
AI data and analytics, et cetera.

873
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,790
And I think there is nothing that lift people's spirits

874
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,760
more than a genuine investment in their capability, in.

875
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,705
Have you kept your spirits up during COVID because you're,

876
00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:09,815
you know, you're very optimistic and positive and, and

877
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:11,595
you know, it can't all have been fun for you either.

878
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:12,435
Yeah.

879
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:14,385
I mean, they would definitely difficult times,

880
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:18,165
but, you know, I, I think I am optimistic

881
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:20,115
because I really believe in what we're doing.

882
00:41:20,115 --> 00:41:24,945
We are adding enormous value to Australia, to all of

883
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:27,825
our customers, to our people, to our shareholders.

884
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:30,345
So I'm really motivated to do a great job for all of them.

885
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,420
And I do get a lot of love and support from

886
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,970
my family, my friends, and I get a lot of

887
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,680
energy from the people that I work with.

888
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,760
So I just have this sense of the more energy I put in.

889
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,440
The more energy is created in a

890
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,510
positive way for everybody to Sharon.

891
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,000
Yeah.

892
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,370
And I can feel the energy just sitting

893
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,800
here, I'm going to leave energized.

894
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,810
Um, what keeps you up?

895
00:41:54,105 --> 00:41:57,795
Uh, yeah, it's very funny because I got asked this

896
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:00,345
at, at, uh, in front of the whole company when we were

897
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:04,605
we're launching, um, um, we, we do a launch event at

898
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,035
the beginning of each year and I got asked that question

899
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:09,375
and I said, you know, honestly, I lie awake at night

900
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:13,545
thinking, why do people not all switched to Optus?

901
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:17,325
I do lie and think about that because we have.

902
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,200
Great coverage.

903
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,680
We cover 98.5% of the population, and we're

904
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,460
20% cheaper than the main incumbent competitor.

905
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,560
And we give people up to sport,

906
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,050
which has free football and fitness.

907
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,020
And we've got the living network that nobody else does.

908
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,120
And our service is better than the others.

909
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:36,360
Oh.

910
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,700
And we have the fastest 5g in Australia.

911
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,050
So why.

912
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:43,245
Why doesn't the whole of Australia switch to office.

913
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:46,215
That's what I lie awake at night thinking,

914
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,555
what else do we need to do to make this a

915
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:50,775
very obvious decision for every customer?

916
00:42:51,225 --> 00:42:52,665
So you're thinking about the big

917
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:55,515
issues, which is so that's a good thing.

918
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:57,945
Um, this is actually the final question.

919
00:42:57,945 --> 00:42:59,595
So if you could give emerging leaders

920
00:42:59,595 --> 00:43:00,915
one piece of advice, what would.

921
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,529
Um, one piece of advice is so hard and in an untitled way.

922
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,950
Um, but I think I would tell people to just pursue.

923
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,430
Challenging roles at the core

924
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,720
of the business that they're in.

925
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,840
I think a lot of people drift to the periphery without

926
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,230
realizing it, but you want to put your energy into solving

927
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,040
big problems for the company and problems at the core

928
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,250
of what they do so that you actually get exposure to the

929
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:33,060
real leavers that make a difference for that company, but

930
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,330
also can then feel the impact and maximize your learning.

931
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:36,510
So.

932
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,290
I guess gravitate towards the difficult, challenging

933
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,140
core areas and not away from those, just because

934
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,150
it feels a bit easier and more rewarding.

935
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,650
Fantastic insights.

936
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,990
