1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,979
- Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,050
I'm Paul Gallagher.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,100
I'm LNG agricultural land use

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,090
planning officer with DPI agriculture.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,710
Thank you for joining us today on this webinar to discuss

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,329
the preliminary draft state significant agricultural land.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,440
I'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,300
custodians of the various lands on which we meet.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,680
today.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,459
I'm presenting from the age-old country, and I wish to

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,369
pay my respects to the elders past, present and emerging.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,839
And I also like to extend those respects to any

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,380
First Nations people attending this webinar today.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,500
We have close to 100 people on online today.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,610
So if you could please keep your microphones

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,910
on mute during the presentations, if you have

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,220
any questions, please post them in the chat

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,489
function, which is at the bottom of the page.

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,470
And we'll work through those questions

20
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:54,410
in the question session at the end.

21
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,140
We may be able to invite you to come off mute and

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,210
discuss the questions but please be mindful that with

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,797
so many people on the on the call, we need to keep

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,840
the discussion the 16th so everybody can have a say.

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,300
If we don't give them any questions today, when the time we

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,210
have, then we'll provide answers to them and put them in our

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,710
Frequently Asked Questions section on our exhibition page.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,620
We'll also make the presentation slides available on

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,890
the exhibition page after the second webinar tomorrow.

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,089
And it would be great if you can make

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,520
your name and organization appear.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,199
But your video and you can do this by hovering

33
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,649
over the video, clicking on the little three

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,020
dots and renaming yourself and your organization.

35
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:42,759
Today's webinar will provide you with a background

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,440
information on the preparation of the preliminary

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,520
draft state significant agricultural land map.

38
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:50,690
The intention is to give you a better understanding of

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,330
the process used to create the map and its potential use

40
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,319
to inform any submission you want to make on the map.

41
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:01,739
DPI agriculture's manager of agricultural land use planning

42
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,799
tomorrow apprentice will speak about the background of the

43
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,120
preparation of the map, how it came about, and how it might

44
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:13,489
be used in future and then DPI agriculture's agricultural

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,290
land use planning officer Helen squires will speak about

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,200
what the map shows the criteria used to develop it.

47
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,160
The feedback we are seeking and how to make an

48
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,670
submission or not now invite tomorrow apprentice

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,250
manager agricultural land use planning and DPI to speak.

50
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,949
- Hi, everyone, my name is Tamara apprentice, and I'm

51
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,850
the manager of the agricultural land use planning team.

52
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,000
As Paul just mentioned, Thank you, Paul.

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,180
And I'm very proud to be here.

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,579
Talking to you all about a map.

55
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,250
As most of you will know, a map has been something

56
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,720
that we have contemplated for agricultural land in

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,940
the planning framework for quite a number of years.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,810
I just like to start by talking about

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,360
the planning framework more generally.

60
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,230
So we can see across the planning framework

61
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,280
that there's differing levels of maturity,

62
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,799
respect, responding to the relative pressures

63
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,560
that each of the sector has faced over time.

64
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,660
- For example, in residential and commercial areas, extensive

65
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,450
planning has been undertaken to identify locations for

66
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,680
high density development, in comparison to in the rural

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,720
areas where they've been subject to less relative pressure.

68
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,870
And we've seen that there's often incompatible

69
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,870
uses clustered within rural zones which have been

70
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,869
applied inconsistently, often across the state.

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,664
In response to this, what we're seeing is

72
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:46,750
an increasing level of land use conflict.

73
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,679
And that's causing financial and emotional

74
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:53,049
hardship on some of the residents and also

75
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,330
increasing compliance burdens for council.

76
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,840
agriculture plays an important role in the

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,020
stability and the growth of regional economies.

78
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,100
It also supplies food and fiber to our cities.

79
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,904
And particularly down around the Sydney region we're

80
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,329
looking at we've seen recently, a call out for fresh

81
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,299
food deserts and the light because of the pressures

82
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,730
pushing agriculture further from those city centers.

83
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,260
agricultural land also plays important roles and

84
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:23,100
depending on location in the state, they can provide

85
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,410
green backdrops, heat sinks and tourism locations.

86
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:30,849
But what has been found during a recent process by the New

87
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,740
South Wales Agriculture Commissioner was that more assertive

88
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,390
and explicit planning was needed for agriculture to achieve

89
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,199
regional growth and agricultural production targets.

90
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,414
During this process, the consultation revealed that there

91
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,849
was almost universal agreement on the need for a map.

92
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,840
agriculture continues to compete across the rural

93
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,469
landscape and is finding itself under pressure from

94
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,310
urban encroachment and land fragmentation as well.

95
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,550
It's hoped that the map might assist to better

96
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,209
inform decisions about the allocation of rural land.

97
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,970
It's also hoped that the map might help educate the

98
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,730
communities and decision makers about the relative

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,160
importance of various sectors of agricultural land.

100
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,659
We know that agricultural land is not all equal,

101
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,030
across 1516, before the drought really took

102
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,829
hold, we know that 17% of our land produced

103
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,020
about 56% of agricultural value in the state.

104
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,510
So it's between six and seven times more productive,

105
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,220
that's 17% of the state is the other 83%, you know,

106
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,520
produce point 5% of that on a percentage basis.

107
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,949
We've developed this map in the hope that we can

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,669
enable a discussion, in the first instance about what

109
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,680
should be mapped, and what that map might look like.

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,420
We know that the map has come out in a very

111
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,080
preliminary draft iteration, we understand that there's

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,590
issues in some of the data sets underpinning it.

113
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,364
And we're really hoping to get some feedback

114
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,529
from yourselves through this process to

115
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,570
try and help us better prepare this map.

116
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,440
The next question that we're getting

117
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,469
frequently is how will the map be used?

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,630
And there's really no easy answer

119
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,340
to this question at this stage.

120
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,679
So the Agriculture Commissioner made some recommendations

121
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:17,650
about how policy could be implemented, which would

122
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,250
help implementation of the map at this stage, the

123
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,470
government has not had a chance to consider its response.

124
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,699
And the whole of government response will

125
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,440
have to be prepared across agencies as

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
well, to say how the map should be used.

127
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,930
Those negotiations will continue over the next few months.

128
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,760
And so at this point in time, the map as it's exhibited,

129
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,780
is not proposed to be used in any particular manner.

130
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,480
What we do know or what we are proposing, at

131
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,440
least is that the maps not going to be used as

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,779
a replacement for base cell in the mining zip,

133
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:51,230
that map was produced for a particular purpose.

134
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,330
This map has been produced for a different purpose.

135
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,950
So it's not proposed to replace that map at this stage.

136
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,979
It's also not proposed to replace important

137
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,060
farmland mapping on the north coast.

138
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,299
So the agriculture Commissioner's report, some of

139
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,740
you might have read highlighted, that was probably

140
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,179
one of the better ways that we could implement this

141
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,080
map over time once we had more confidence in it.

142
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,215
But until that, until that happens, we're not

143
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,750
proposing that those maps be replaced at this point.

144
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,450
The map may also need to be supplemented by work to

145
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,110
identify locally or regionally significant farmland.

146
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:27,359
So we know that certain regions have particular

147
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
attributes that need to be called out.

148
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,230
And this map certainly shouldn't prevent that occurring.

149
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,680
It's just to try and help provide consistency

150
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,276
across the state as to where our most

151
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,539
productive land in the state should be.

152
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,299
And I think that's about it from me.

153
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,710
Paul, were there any immediate questions?

154
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,560
Or shall I hand over to yourself or Helen?

155
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,130
- No, thanks, Tamara.

156
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,820
We don't have any questions in the chat at this stage.

157
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:12,141
So hello, if you'd like to speak

158
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:12,384
on the construction of the map.

159
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:12,587
Thank you pool swipe tool.

160
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:14,540
So how is the map prepared the site significant

161
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,070
ag land map, as Tamara mentioned earlier,

162
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,829
is definitely in its early draft stage.

163
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,320
And it's predominantly brought together

164
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,580
by three groups of information.

165
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,130
The first area is we're talking about

166
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,159
land with certain biophysical attributes.

167
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,929
So such things such as water availability,

168
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,280
soil and land capability, soil type, and slope.

169
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,009
And we'll touch more on some of

170
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,029
those details in the next slide.

171
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,740
But basically, we're looking at characteristics

172
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
that are known and that don't readily change.

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,550
The next group of information that we're

174
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,790
looking at the irrigated areas across the state.

175
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,539
So when we describe irrigated areas that might be

176
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,629
land that has only one or two irrigations throughout

177
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:04,810
the year, or irrigation areas that heavily rely

178
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,350
on throughout the whole growing season irrigated

179
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,840
lands produce a significantly large volume of

180
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,880
produce per hectare compared to non irrigated lands.

181
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,100
So this is why we've sort of pulled it out

182
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:20,130
and identify that on its own merit there.

183
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,990
Because a significant amount of infrastructure and

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,250
investment from both government and obviously from a private

185
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,520
industry has gone into to this particular method of farming.

186
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,209
We know that water licenses are traded, and

187
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,400
so that the location of water licenses haven't

188
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,750
actually been used to help identify the

189
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,749
irrigation areas in this particular draft of them.

190
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,100
That may be something that we

191
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,989
will look at labor down the track.

192
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,979
We've identified irrigation areas through the use of the

193
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,150
Australian collaborative land use management program data.

194
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,780
So that's a national data Bit that looks at

195
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,930
land use management across different times.

196
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,920
So obviously, taking into consideration, droughts

197
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,339
and other climatic instances that affect irrigation

198
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,900
use, we've taken a 10 year snapshot of that.

199
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,450
So from 2007 through to the 2017 data sets.

200
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,930
The other group of information, as Tamara

201
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,330
mentioned before, is the state and regionally

202
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,740
significant farmland on the north coast.

203
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,660
So the Agriculture Commissioner report pulled

204
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,290
this out and identified it that is quite a

205
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,530
rigorous and scientifically backed data set.

206
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,840
So the Northern Rivers farmland project identified

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,030
the North Coast mapping in this area in 2005.

208
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:48,969
And then the mid north coast mapping came through in 2008.

209
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,910
So it is primarily based on

210
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,729
biophysical characteristics as well.

211
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,029
But it was had a lot more input from the farming communities

212
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,600
and reference groups, and then it was tested and verified

213
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,569
by soil scientists and industry leaders in that space.

214
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,380
So they're the three sort of groups of information

215
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,849
that we're using to help build the map at this stage.

216
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,260
And just, as Tamara mentioned, the North Coast

217
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,459
farmland mapping has been used in the planning

218
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,360
system or planning framework since 2005.

219
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,900
And has been accepted by planning

220
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,569
authorities and the community for some time.

221
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:49,790
Just I'm just having a trying to get away from it.

222
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,630
Next slide there.

223
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,210
Before I dive into what we use to build the map, I just

224
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,800
want to touch base on things that we didn't use, or

225
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:02,635
we've excluded from the development of the SSA l map.

226
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,050
So naturally, we excluded all national parks

227
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,600
areas, state forests, wetlands, and land

228
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,499
that has a slope higher than 18 degrees.

229
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,989
And that was based off the steep

230
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,139
and Holly erodible lands dataset.

231
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,609
From the NB RM map.

232
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,740
We also want to identify that remote that

233
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,940
the areas mapped adjust in the LEP zones

234
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,640
that are permissible for agriculture.

235
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:36,390
So we're looking at the rural use zone, so the

236
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,290
primary production zone, rural landscape, farming

237
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,890
production, small lots and the transition zone.

238
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,670
We also have many councils that are currently

239
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,129
conducting land use strategies at present.

240
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,180
And so we know that a lot of agriculture is

241
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:53,094
currently undertaken in the environmental

242
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,890
management, environmental living zones.

243
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,150
And we're just wanting to identify what

244
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,830
was happening in those spaces as well.

245
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,390
The Food Matters are also used in the

246
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,780
north coast, because of the underlying

247
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
important family mapping for the North Coast.

248
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,450
And in the next version of the SSI l map, we will

249
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,990
look at deferred matters across the rest of the state.

250
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,960
Jumping into the variables that we

251
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,770
looked at to help build the SSL map.

252
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,780
The first one is the land and soil capability mapping.

253
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,069
So this is a data set that pulls together the best available

254
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,090
souls and Natural Resources mapping across New South Wales.

255
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,150
So it provides a broad scale regional view

256
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,940
to the dominant land and soil capability.

257
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,420
And it's built on eight key Soil and Landscape limitations.

258
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,719
So soil types like land composition, acidity,

259
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,120
salinity, drainage, roughness and climate.

260
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,070
The land is then given a class ranging from one to

261
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,480
eight, and one being the best land or land that has

262
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,129
the less amount of limitations right through the age

263
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,520
which is predominantly the nature conservation areas

264
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,480
and borders and pretty much national parks areas.

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,680
The next map flag that we were using to help build

266
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,489
the criteria is the inherent soil fertility data lab.

267
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,519
So this provides an estimate of the well of the

268
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,910
inherent fertility of the soils across New South Wales.

269
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,610
So it's based on a five class system from low

270
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,500
through to high and it was derived from linking

271
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,349
soil fertility to a particular soil type.

272
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,649
We then use P page and this was

273
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,890
done at two different depths.

274
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,460
So zero to five and five to 15 into that area.

275
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,150
We also acknowledged that water availability is

276
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,170
obviously here, water is king in the agricultural world.

277
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,100
And so we've used a limit of 500 Notice of rainfall or

278
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,079
above, or lands that are within a certain distance to

279
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,550
reliable surface water being either regulated rivers or

280
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,300
stream water greater than five, and productive granules.

281
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,350
So many of these layers will help, we'll use to help build

282
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:25,810
the basis that was created back in 2012, or 13, I believe.

283
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,660
And so we've just expanded on those criteria and data sets.

284
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,759
And we also know that there's not a one

285
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,840
size fits all across the whole state.

286
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,540
So what we've done is we've ran a series of different

287
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,360
scenarios, where we use a variety of models to mix the

288
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,800
criteria to identify the SFL S A L across the state.

289
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,760
So for example, where rainfall was higher, but soil

290
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,780
fertility was lower, that would be identified as where soil

291
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,130
fertility was higher, but rainfall was less reliable than

292
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,049
you did a strongest for fertility or soil type in that area.

293
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:15,180
So we also just want to point out that the basis of

294
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,680
these mapping is on the resources of the land and

295
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,030
climate, the inherent characteristics of that land.

296
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,130
It doesn't pick up land management, so we acknowledge

297
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,940
that some biophysical characteristics such as soil

298
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,560
pH can be managed to make the land more productive.

299
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,460
However, management practices rely on the activities

300
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,290
of that particular landowner, and should ownership

301
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,629
change, then the land management might change.

302
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,349
So that's why we're just looking

303
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,720
at the inherent capabilities.

304
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:58,330
Oh, that's there.

305
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,489
- Just go away again.

306
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,470
Everybody here, I might just walk through

307
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,160
the exhibition page that we have here.

308
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,680
And just show you where you can provide

309
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,620
feedback and what we're looking for.

310
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,263
Just jump in.

311
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:23,650
So here, we have the landing page for the exhibition page.

312
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,000
So a bit more background as to why we're

313
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,940
doing it and that it's development.

314
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:35,870
Here we have, sorry, scroll a bit bar, the SSI l map.

315
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,110
And we'll go into there in a minute.

316
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,520
Here's an opportunity also to complete a survey

317
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,929
to provide more details about the map in general,

318
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,720
rather than specific points on the map, and also

319
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,209
to register for further updates on the project.

320
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,044
Because as we mentioned, this is just the first

321
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,809
stage and it will be a rolling development.

322
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,050
So here are some documents that

323
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,459
we will be that are available.

324
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,740
So a short summary on the methodology that outlines

325
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,190
the criteria that I just mentioned, should you want to

326
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,080
just go in and have a look at the data sets that I use.

327
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,639
And also here is the report from the Agricultural

328
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,070
Commissioner that outlines the recommendations.

329
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,500
Down here, we also have a series of frequently

330
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,579
asked questions that you can we encourage

331
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,374
everyone to just jump in and have a look.

332
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:31,550
And hopefully it might answer some

333
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,440
other questions that you might have.

334
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:45,850
- So when we jump into the map itself, just greeted

335
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,180
with it with a welcoming statement just here.

336
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,890
You can see that you can read the map, move it around.

337
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,910
In zoom in and out, we would like to have a look.

338
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,479
But we want to emphasize that regardless of which level

339
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:08,800
A map is viewed at its precision is basically determined

340
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,730
on the quality of the data used to create the map.

341
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,550
So you might notice that some areas

342
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:15,889
are more accurate than others.

343
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,055
And this is predominantly because of

344
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,740
the underlying data that was used.

345
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,610
Some are more false than others.

346
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:26,429
But the map at the present is very broad scale.

347
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,959
And it's designed to use for strategic

348
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,750
planning purposes at the local regional level.

349
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,885
It's not suitable for property specific planning, such

350
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,869
as assessment development proposals or spot rezonings.

351
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,650
So that will require a greater level of accuracy.

352
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,859
So in those areas where the data is less accurate,

353
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:50,070
that's where we would love to hear feedback from you.

354
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,070
And that can be done in a variety of different ways.

355
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,229
So if there's something that you like or dislike,

356
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:06,329
simply grab an icon and put it down where then we would

357
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,300
like to make a comment, filling the comment about what

358
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,960
you like or dislike, and, and further details there.

359
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,893
And that's how you provide feedback on the map.

360
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:25,230
There's also, if you have any ideas or suggestions or just

361
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:31,460
a general comment as well, should you want to just get the

362
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,980
outline of how to do that, just click on the how to use map

363
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,150
and it'll give you a step by step guide on how to do that.

364
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,170
Over here, we also have a bit more information

365
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,860
about the project, if you wanting to get

366
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,680
that background again, while viewing the map.

367
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,260
You also have the feedback activity.

368
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
So where somebody has come in and made

369
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,460
a comment, you can start a discussion.

370
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,629
Or you can like or dislike that comment.

371
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,749
And you can also go straight to the survey here.

372
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,570
So you can go straight to here and fill out the survey.

373
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,710
So there's a variety of different ways that we can have a

374
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,380
look at the map and provide feedback directly on the map.

375
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:17,960
Just close that one off.

376
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,820
Go back to the presentation.

377
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,560
So in this exhibition period at the

378
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,090
moment, what sort of feedback are we after?

379
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,370
We're looking to see if we've used

380
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,070
the right criteria for the mapping?

381
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,370
And if we haven't, what criteria is missing?

382
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,439
We're also looking at, is there any other data sets

383
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:47,350
that are out there that we we have not used yet.

384
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,479
So ideally, we'd like to use statewide data sets.

385
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,510
However, if there's data sets that are at the local regional

386
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,379
scale, then we'll certainly review those and see if we

387
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,030
can incorporate them in the next version of the draft.

388
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,109
If there's land that's not mapped as Sal, but

389
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,520
you think it shouldn't be, please let us know.

390
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,519
But if you could please provide an

391
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,850
explanation as to why it should be included.

392
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,960
And conversely, if it's SSL, a

393
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,770
melt, and it shouldn't be, please.

394
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,750
Yeah, provide some commentary around.

395
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:26,189
So that's the sort of feedback that we're looking

396
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,799
for in the development and map, as Colin Tamara

397
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,120
mentioned, it's definitely at an early stage.

398
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,270
But there's something like this, it's important

399
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,689
that we let people know that we're developing

400
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,699
this project, and we want to get community input

401
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,209
and industry and government input right across.

402
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:50,490
So I think that pretty much wraps up the map and how

403
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,899
it was developed and the sort of feedback that we have.

404
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,949
So I'm I came back.

405
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,050
- Thanks.

406
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,060
How long?

407
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,230
Have you been boattail?

408
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,260
And Mara, we've had a couple of

409
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,159
questions being raised in the chat.

410
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,579
Now, I'll direct a couple of these to both of you.

411
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:11,540
Helen, Alex asked whether environmental zones

412
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,040
biodiversity and Aboriginal heritage will be protected.

413
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,654
Can you just I think you've

414
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:19,860
touched on it in your discussion.

415
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,329
Can you give us a quick rundown how environmental

416
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,069
zones were considered in the mapping?

417
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:33,090
- Yes, so we've, we use environmental zones to just

418
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,689
identify where some SS Al is in there because of

419
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,549
those council areas that we're looking to rezone.

420
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,800
But then, in the next draft, we exclude areas

421
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,070
such as cultural and heritage and other areas

422
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,980
that might come into environmental sensitive

423
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,710
areas, and those sort of laser already taken out.

424
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,240
So they're not within the FSA on that.

425
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,250
- Thank you, Tamara.

426
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,439
Robert Shelley's asked the agriculture Commission's

427
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:11,849
report, this is the sequence of events.

428
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:16,919
First of all, revision of a map and a policy to go with it.

429
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,639
You touched on possible policy, when you

430
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:22,660
detach, you need the government's response.

431
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,620
Could you just elaborate on on that question, please?

432
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,520
- Yeah, sure.

433
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,919
So the report by the New South Wales Ag Commissioner did

434
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,829
sort of talk about the exhibition of a map and a policy

435
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,280
at the same time, so that we knew how it would be applied.

436
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,790
It's proposed that any future policy will be exhibited.

437
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,370
So this exhibition of the map is the first in what will

438
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,429
be a series of iterations to try and refine the map.

439
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,110
And so it is proposed that once there has been some

440
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,379
cross-government agreement as to what that policy might

441
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,659
look like that it will then be exhibited in conjunction

442
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,800
with the next iteration of the map, hopefully At this

443
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,889
point in time, we thought we wanted to start the process

444
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,780
of the mapping iterations to try and make sure that the

445
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,470
map got to the best possible format as quickly as possible.

446
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,159
And so we thought it would be prudent to get

447
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,360
the first version out on exhibition while those

448
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,620
government negotiations took place in the background.

449
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:23,969
- Okay, Helen, flood prone land and mining leases.

450
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,080
How is the map dealt with those two issues?

451
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:30,309
Combining a couple of questions here, just because

452
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,730
there's likely to start getting quite a few.

453
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,270
- Yeah.

454
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,949
So flood prone areas have been still included in the SSA L.

455
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,269
Because we know that some of the those areas are

456
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,769
grateful daring lands and other key industries.

457
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,950
So if the criteria match that, and it's

458
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,070
on flood prone areas, then it's still

459
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,589
included in relation to mining lace areas.

460
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,530
It's we haven't taken into consideration that at

461
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,179
this stage, but the next draft will be including

462
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,450
the any areas that spot development consent, or

463
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,550
disturbance footprint consent for mining areas.

464
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,010
So that will happen in the in the next draft.

465
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:17,550
- Thank you.

466
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,543
And as Tamara pointed out that the intention of the

467
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,500
map is not to replace the BCL map in the mining sector.

468
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
- So, yes, and I will.

469
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,470
So to add on that that also includes

470
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,140
the critical industry clusters.

471
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,555
So this map will not replace those

472
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,700
- Elen, the ANC plans suggested that the New South

473
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,769
Wales land use survey mapping may be helpful.

474
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:47,410
Have we used that as a reference?

475
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,240
Or could we?

476
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,879
- Yes, that's been looked at and incorporated, to cross

477
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,229
reference some of the information that we've got.

478
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,889
So we'll look a little bit deeper

479
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:01,430
into the next draft of that.

480
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,710
But it's certainly been a layer that we've we've

481
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,120
used to cross reference, but we've currently not.

482
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,739
- And where could people find further details of

483
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:18,949
each of their criteria, such as slope, did extended

484
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,480
rockiness Strange characteristics and things like that

485
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,570
during the biophysical characteristics of the land?

486
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,280
Yeah.

487
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,360
- So on the exhibition page there, and under the

488
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,180
Documents section, there's a summary statement that

489
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,969
outlines the methodology that we've used so far.

490
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,300
And in that document, there's a list

491
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,409
of the data sets that we have used.

492
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,550
And we've primarily used publicly available data that

493
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,159
everyone has access to, to go in and have a look.

494
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,690
And it has links to that.

495
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,549
So there's a dam at the New South Wales data portal,

496
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,750
we'll have a link to the land and soil capability mapping.

497
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,510
So if people go in there, then they can download that

498
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,149
data layer and have a look at the levels of rockiness

499
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,069
or acidity or the limitation that was used to determine

500
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:12,070
that particular land, land and soil capability.

501
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,120
- Thank you.

502
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,830
We what we might do is we'll keep going through the

503
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,469
chat questions, but could we get in quite a few.

504
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:28,039
But if anyone would like to speak to their

505
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,030
question, if you could raise your hand the

506
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,840
reaction chat reactions down the bottom.

507
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,710
And we might be able to, to talk through that bearing

508
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,870
in mind that we might take a little bit longer to get

509
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,089
through all the questions if we're talking to them.

510
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,860
They'll go on with the next one.

511
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,969
Tomorrow.

512
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,889
- The North Coast area the North Coast mapping is currently

513
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,750
used to inform rezonings and around urban areas.

514
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,700
Will this approach be continued with the

515
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,830
use of the SSA all maps are to be finalized?

516
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,550
- So thanks for the question, Natalie.

517
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,639
The way that the map will be

518
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:21,139
applied is yet to be determined.

519
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,489
But DPI do provide guidance based on the

520
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,479
best available information that we have.

521
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:28,370
And on the north coast.

522
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,090
There's a lot of community support for

523
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,350
the mapping as it currently stands.

524
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,890
And so we think that it's reasonable to consider that even

525
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,699
if the mapping, you know, is correct at a regional scale

526
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,999
and might have some edge effects, generally it provides

527
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,846
us an indication of where the most productive lands are.

528
00:29:43,846 --> 00:29:46,500
And so we do use that to inform the responses

529
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,280
that we made to particular proposals.

530
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,230
I don't think that this will change.

531
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,190
I expect that we will continue to use the best available

532
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,056
data sets to inform the responses, you know that we made.

533
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:01,429
And I'm hoping that answers the

534
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,970
question and the intent behind it.

535
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,430
Natalie.

536
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,959
- Thanks, Tamara, Andrea, Roundtree, you would like to

537
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,269
you'd like to come off mute and ask your question.

538
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,100
- Yes, I was just wondering if we already know that

539
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,290
15% of the land in the state is producing 85% of

540
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,230
the agricultural projects have those areas already?

541
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I mean, no, no, this is sort of trying to identify them.

542
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,240
But we already know where a lot of those areas

543
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,860
are, have they already been marked off on the map?

544
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,010
- Andre, I can have a go at answering

545
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,360
that Helens an expert in it.

546
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,790
But I'll have a go.

547
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,249
We we have an idea.

548
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,070
So the 15% is made up of various types of

549
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,090
industries that have contributed so yourself, I

550
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:56,300
think, from memory, you're in intensive livestock.

551
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,250
So that 15% doesn't actually include the intensive

552
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,850
livestock because that data set that the intensive

553
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,250
livestock production systems are not necessarily

554
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,610
reliant in my understanding at least and you know, this

555
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,600
better than I do, on particular soil characteristics.

556
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,810
So the available data sets that we had at the time and

557
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,280
still currently have a soil biophysical characteristics.

558
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,719
So what we're proposing to do, as an addendum to this

559
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,540
process is identify what we're calling production areas.

560
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,290
So those areas where there are clusters or

561
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,879
known intensive livestock systems that we

562
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,909
can then map as an addendum to this map.

563
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,810
So the 15% that I spoke about picks up things

564
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,800
like horticulture, and viticulture, and,

565
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,870
and some of those cropping areas as well.

566
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,860
Now, we don't know where all of them are.

567
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:46,090
And some of them may be intermittent as

568
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,649
well, you know, there might have been less

569
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,620
area crop during the drought, for example.

570
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:52,560
And some that have just used consistently because

571
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,520
they've got access to more reliable water.

572
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,246
So we've mapped as best as we can, where we think that

573
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:02,930
those that 15% is, but we're not, we're not 100%, just

574
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,079
because of the accuracy of some of the underlying data

575
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,480
sets, hence why we're hoping you guys will tell us

576
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,300
where we're right and wrong as part of this process.

577
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,020
I just, it'll be good for intensive livestock, because

578
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,919
it isn't dependent, exactly on the soil type and the

579
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,249
rainfall, but you we need the protection around the beam

580
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:24,390
that goes in there to not have conflict of land use.

581
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,100
So yeah, I think it would be really good if they were

582
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:30,429
not as an addendum that included straightaway showing.

583
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,060
They're already there.

584
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,240
They're already productive.

585
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,860
And we do need protection from all those other land uses.

586
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:40,629
So yeah, there's another part of the process that

587
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,610
we're doing, which is to identify buffer areas.

588
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,169
And one of the recommendations in the

589
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,510
report was that we make that a required

590
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,300
consideration in the planning framework.

591
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,169
So that there's mandatory consideration not

592
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,020
to say that the buffers have to be mandatorily

593
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,410
applied, but at least they're a consideration.

594
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,000
And what we're doing as part of that processing currently

595
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,620
is just having a look at our interim buffer guidelines,

596
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,930
and just determining whether there is enough scientific

597
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,879
rigor behind them, and how we can ensure that they are

598
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:11,040
fit for purpose and pick up the industries that we need.

599
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,139
And then providing an education program to councils

600
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,859
as well as consultants and the community around.

601
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,630
You know why it's so critically important to have

602
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,090
buffers around intensive livestock proposals.

603
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,620
The issue with the map is we don't

604
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,100
know yet how it's going to be moved.

605
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,010
So us so we could map the intensive livestock.

606
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,820
So the ones that we know about and and again, look based on

607
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,310
what's happened in the past with, you know, people having

608
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,710
intensive livestock is identified on a map and then having

609
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,080
people come along and vigilantism against those proposals.

610
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,520
It's difficult sometimes to try and map things accurately.

611
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,990
- We're already on a map.

612
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,042
So don't locations are not secret already.

613
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:53,620
But we there, there are no reciprocal buffer distances.

614
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,250
That's why we need to be on this map.

615
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,370
Because there's those buffer distances that people

616
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,470
you know, the DPI and various other government

617
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,540
departments have been talking about, and for years and

618
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,220
years and years, and they just haven't happened yet.

619
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,099
So please don't exclude us from this

620
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:12,070
process, because we need to be part of it.

621
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:12,810
- Yes.

622
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,409
All right.

623
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,140
No, thank you.

624
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,290
Look, we would do well, we're going to do everything

625
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,100
we can to try and make sure that there's less

626
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,500
land use conflict, like the trajectory of land use

627
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,749
conflicts was one of the key findings in this report.

628
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:25,830
And coupled with that, like the mental and

629
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,930
economic implications of that on the farmers

630
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,030
and the community and the landowners adjacent.

631
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,740
So we're going to do everything we can to

632
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,350
try and help that ladies conflict issue.

633
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,229
- Thank you both for that question.

634
00:34:40,229 --> 00:34:44,030
A couple of questions relating to land

635
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,269
use planning and councils local strategic

636
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,060
planning, strategies and regional plans.

637
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,199
Tomorrow do would you like to talk to how we are

638
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:02,720
working with councils and DPI II Due to align

639
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,310
with regional planning work being undertaken?

640
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,540
- Yeah.

641
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,460
So the intention is not that the map picks

642
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,150
up land identifies as urban growth area

643
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,920
bound, like within the existing urban growth

644
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,940
area boundaries or for urban expansion.

645
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,926
So, if there are inconsistencies in our map with those

646
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,240
areas that are earmarked for expansion, please let us know.

647
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,759
And we'll make sure that we can, we can rectify that.

648
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,680
The intention, however, is to identify land,

649
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,920
which is of significance to the state in terms of

650
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,870
agricultural production in the hope that future

651
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,420
iterations of LSPs and regional plans direct

652
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,529
growth where possible away from these areas.

653
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,899
Now, that's not always going to

654
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,389
be possible, and we get that.

655
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,650
But where the where there is a possible alternative

656
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,740
location, we would hope that this map would help

657
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,310
in providing that guidance to say, you know, this

658
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,380
is really about valuable land for this purpose,

659
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,940
perhaps you can do your expansion in another

660
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,310
direction, or look density as a as an alternative.

661
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,407
So yeah, we're hoping to get consistency with the regional

662
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,080
plans as much as possible, the LSPs is a little bit

663
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,819
more difficult, we don't have as much oversight of them.

664
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:10,450
And there's quite a lot of them.

665
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,859
So again, really happy to take your feedback, if you

666
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,280
do see, council identified both areas, you know, Matt,

667
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,980
are happy to consider what's been said in that space.

668
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,990
And we also hope to be able to refine the map as the

669
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,750
LSPs is reviewed, and the regional plans, you know,

670
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,225
look to what the LSP PS is saying, as well as what this

671
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:31,400
map is saying and to try and get that harmony between,

672
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,140
you know, predicted growth areas and proposed growth

673
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,549
areas across the state and meeting those regional local

674
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:40,110
lender and state needs for agricultural production.

675
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,299
Thanks, Tamara, Lorraine Wilson, you put your hand up,

676
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:50,010
would you like to come off Newton and ask your question?

677
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,889
Thank you might be so we unmute the line, we can't hear you.

678
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:03,389
- Okay, I come from the Central Coast.

679
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,470
pedo.

680
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,400
And Tamara, I was really surprised when I looked at

681
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,209
the map the other day and discovered that there were

682
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,734
a lot of areas on this plateau it on this Plateau

683
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,049
Region that obviously had agriculture going on now.

684
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:29,189
But we're not signified with the cell outline.

685
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,339
And I take on board, what you're saying about local

686
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:37,970
governments needing to expand and subdivide, there would be

687
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:43,530
little like likelihood that our local council would want to

688
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:49,930
extend subdivision areas out on to our plateau, because the

689
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,420
cost of providing services out here would be astronomical.

690
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,900
So it's not an area, the only thing that is happening

691
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,709
here that is impacting his rural residential where

692
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:10,550
people with enough money are able to buy up previously

693
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:17,040
agricultural land to put a horse or two on, on for,

694
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,659
you know, teenage daughters and things like that.

695
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,220
But we have a huge nursery cut flower,

696
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:28,510
beef production, chicken, meat, stone,

697
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,210
fruit, avocado and citrus industries here.

698
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,060
And fours, a relatively small sub region of the

699
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:43,500
state, our productivity is, is quite, is quite large.

700
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,240
So my question is, two in two parts, I guess.

701
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,760
When you were mapping it, did you not have a look at what

702
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,529
was actually there in front of you on the Google Maps and

703
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:10,580
not recognize, improve pasture for instance, areas or, and

704
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:16,620
I go back to what the other lady was saying, obviously,

705
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,360
a lot of chicken sheds, which you're not prepared.

706
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,009
And I get it, we have been at the mercy

707
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:29,310
of animal laborers and things like that.

708
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:34,260
But we also need to recognize where productivity is.

709
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:35,859
Yeah.

710
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,040
Can you answer that question anyway?

711
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:38,650
Why?

712
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,259
Why you obviously did not mark where

713
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:43,470
farming production was happening.

714
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,040
Yeah.

715
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,899
And the reason is, we don't have the resources to look

716
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,450
at every single property and mark where production

717
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,349
is occurring at that scale at this point in time.

718
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:56,900
So this map is a very, very much a first pass.

719
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,986
We've looked at the existing data sets that

720
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,675
we've that we've had and ended the land use,

721
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,575
and Helen's just been through all of those.

722
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,430
And we basically overlaid them.

723
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,839
And then those areas that popped out

724
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,849
as meeting the criteria were included.

725
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:11,410
And those that weren't, we're not.

726
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,712
And there was, there was no team of 500 to go

727
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,720
through and go, You know what, this is a really

728
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,200
stupid outcome, we really need to fix that, because

729
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
we just didn't have one the local knowledge, or

730
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,720
Secondly, the resources and time to be able to do it.

731
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,679
So hence why this will be the first in

732
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:29,450
what will be a series of exhibitions.

733
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,210
And we desperately need that feedback from

734
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,200
yourself, because there's going to be areas that

735
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,009
we have mapped, which are less than productive.

736
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,810
I have two farms.

737
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,050
One kangaroo wants to pack lunch.

738
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,540
And the other one is amazing.

739
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,450
You can't walk through there for

740
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,420
the grass at the moment, both Matt.

741
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:46,219
And like, we know, that's because the

742
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:47,900
underlying data sets are not great.

743
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,910
And it's just a case of taking that local knowledge

744
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,850
and saying, Hey, look, this area is really important.

745
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,810
There's an export terminal proposed.

746
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,990
In Newcastle port, we're looking at a sap

747
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,750
which relies on agribusiness production.

748
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,030
So we need protected productive areas within proximity

749
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,980
to enable economic transport of the goods and the like.

750
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,986
So that we can when we are starting to look

751
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:10,970
at a review of this map, say, hey, look,

752
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,100
there's a heat more pressures on the coast.

753
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,850
And we know that there are and potentially,

754
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,610
if we've got an extra bit of land that comes

755
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,350
out here, maybe we could put that in there.

756
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,350
Now we can't map the whole of the state.

757
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,140
The intention of this map is to say this part

758
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,580
of the landscape is critical to agriculture.

759
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,260
The other part of the landscape, perhaps can serve

760
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,200
alternate purpose like tourism and whatever else, but this

761
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,779
part we really want to protect so that we can intensify

762
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:38,610
and not have land use conflict and provide certainty.

763
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,560
So we're very mindful that we want to keep it a very

764
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,180
targeted map with a percentage, or with an area of

765
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,320
land map that we know, you know, is of superior value.

766
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,819
And also, you know, we can provide those planning,

767
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,220
I'd say protections or that planning direction

768
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,569
around this is the preferred future use for this

769
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,830
land, you know, and still enable other other uses

770
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,200
that are that are needed to occur elsewhere as well.

771
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,640
So, so no, sorry, I've gone off track a little bit.

772
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,550
But no, we did it nicely advised.

773
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,757
Spread this map around to all the New South Wales

774
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,319
farmers members up here, and our chamber of commerce

775
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,310
members and alert people in the local little

776
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,360
newsletter and say, for heaven's sake, right.

777
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,720
Go on with and make sure your places

778
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,160
murky, you know, Yep, absolutely.

779
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:28,150
Yeah, absolutely.

780
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,940
And we need that, because we just, I mean, I'm not

781
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,070
guaranteeing that comments will be taken on board, we

782
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,079
might not make changes, because we might not have the

783
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,660
data to be able to support making that particular change.

784
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,810
But if we don't have the information to say it's

785
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,390
wrong, or it needs fixing, or it needs this to begin

786
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,060
with, then we just can't even look at that, you know,

787
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,280
so very much please share it around to get as much

788
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,480
feedback to us as possible, we would love to hear it.

789
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:53,789
When we're not precious, we're not thinking

790
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:56,680
that this is perfect already by any stretch.

791
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,206
So please,

792
00:42:57,206 --> 00:43:00,665
- I have to be honest to the desert number of those

793
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,160
landholders would be hoping to subdivide at some stage.

794
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:08,439
In your region, there's a big push for rural

795
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,450
residential, you've got one of the biggest

796
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,759
problems across the state we're facing at the

797
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,299
moment is rural arrays around your region.

798
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:19,230
So look, and that's it.

799
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,479
But again, it's critical.

800
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,440
You've got rural readers, and people live there with

801
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,800
an expectation of a rural residential lifestyle.

802
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,900
And if someone puts a poultry farm or there

803
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,809
is an existing poultry farm next door,

804
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,140
you know what they smell, there's trucks.

805
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:31,910
It's noisy.

806
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,400
And and that's what we're trying to prevent.

807
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,420
So is that is that land use conflict?

808
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,309
And yeah, so yeah, please, any feedback

809
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:40,770
that we can get in that respect?

810
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,329
I like to eat chicken too.

811
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,410
And it's cheap.

812
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,830
So you know, and it's cheap.

813
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,779
So people buy it.

814
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:46,399
That's right.

815
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,290
Thank you.

816
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,860
Thank you tomorrow.

817
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,200
- I might just build on that.

818
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,310
On.

819
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,800
Following on that is that another recommendation

820
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,450
from the agriculture commissioners report is to

821
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,080
potentially look at industry production areas.

822
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,660
So it might have been heard of IPAs?

823
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:10,840
So that's a second mapping project that DPR investigating.

824
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,590
So that would pick up sort of key industries that might not

825
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,230
fall under the biophysical map of the FSA al at the moment.

826
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:20,567
- Thanks, Helen.

827
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:20,692
Just a couple of quick questions, Helen.

828
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:29,460
I wrote a few together from the chat again.

829
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,120
There was a question about small areas of land

830
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,810
being mapped and and being included on the

831
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,259
map as well as a question about some of the

832
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:44,060
vineyards in the Hunter region not being mapped.

833
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,980
Could you talk to those questions, please?

834
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,539
Yeah, sure.

835
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,840
So the the map that's being developed at the

836
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,660
moment, we primarily just putting the criteria and

837
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,699
determining what land popped up based on that criteria.

838
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:03,030
When we do that The next few iterations that will

839
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,443
dissolve some of these small areas, so we have to

840
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:08,080
then go in outside whether they get incorporated

841
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,740
or taken out depending on the size of school areas.

842
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,680
So that's why it is a bit of a mottled effect in some

843
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:21,000
places in relation to that, say vineyards or, for

844
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,319
example, if you've got a blueberry farm or something,

845
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,400
it depends on whether the criteria fit into that.

846
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,770
So we haven't targeted this map

847
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,840
based on a particular industry.

848
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,029
So if an industry doesn't sort of fall within

849
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:37,779
that, those biophysical characteristics that were

850
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,529
falling across the stage, that it may have the

851
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,820
possibility to be picked up in the IPA process.

852
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,800
That was the best second recommendation

853
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,300
from the Agricultural Commissioners.

854
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:52,389
I do want to re emphasize, though, for the viticulture

855
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,120
industries, will around the hunter area, though it does

856
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,080
not cancel out the critical industry cluster there.

857
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,654
So thanks, Helen.

858
00:46:03,654 --> 00:46:05,589
Another couple of questions.

859
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,450
Just before we go to you, Sam, the there's a couple of

860
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,160
questions in the chat about buffer distances and buffer

861
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,439
guidance, broadly speaking, and now the agriculture

862
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,060
commissioners report did make a recommendation about

863
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,400
DPI having a look at the you know, the issue of buffers.

864
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,730
And that is a piece of work that DPI will be

865
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,560
doing in parallel with this with this map.

866
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,800
And just quickly tomorrow, there was a question about how

867
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,460
the mapping aligns with the large scale solar guidelines.

868
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,820
Current SSD developments for solar and wind projects,

869
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,159
would you quickly talk to that for go to Sam?

870
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,200
- Ah, yep.

871
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,800
So look, the the currently the large scale solar guidelines

872
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,839
that have been adopted by a DPI a planning, talk about

873
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,850
avoiding land and soil capability classes 123 were possible.

874
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,579
That's that's the only public guidance at the moment.

875
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,060
Currently, there's no as mentioned earlier, there's

876
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,960
no policy in how this map will be applied or how

877
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,039
influence particularly development decisions,

878
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:17,599
or even the strategic planning framework.

879
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,500
So at this point in time, the answer probably is from a

880
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,480
regulatory point of view, there's no nexus at this point

881
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,230
between the map and where those proposals are going to go.

882
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:29,779
Now, I'm not confident that that's going to

883
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,469
be the position that's taken by the community.

884
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,930
And in particular, particularly communities,

885
00:47:37,009 --> 00:47:39,569
community sentiment is seeking from what we're

886
00:47:39,569 --> 00:47:42,390
hearing, at least, that product or cultural land

887
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,050
should necessarily possibly be excluded, where

888
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,870
possible from coverage by solar farms and the like.

889
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,250
But, I mean, the the issue that we have

890
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,870
is that the currently there is no policy

891
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,240
about how this that will be applied.

892
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,490
So we can't use the map to

893
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:58,990
influence existing SSD applications.

894
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:02,270
What I would say is that the map has

895
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,040
been based on a criteria that's known,

896
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,140
so existing map data sets that are known.

897
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,520
And those map data sets are in the public arena and have

898
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,869
been interpreted for production of this map, but also

899
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:14,920
gives a fair indication of land which is productive.

900
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,880
Now, crudely, we've referred to land and soil

901
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,230
capability classes 123, just for ease, and

902
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,590
we'll probably will continue to do do that.

903
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,520
So to some extent, but there will be a lot of

904
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,760
consistency between land, soil capability classes, 123.

905
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,319
And these map as well.

906
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:34,940
So while the map in and of itself doesn't have

907
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,720
a regulatory role, what I would suggest is that

908
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,430
he does indicate where, at least on paper, some

909
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,500
of the best agricultural lands in the state are.

910
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,419
And that might then lead to some sort of community

911
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,719
expectation that that land might be considered

912
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:51,680
for agricultural purposes as a higher priority

913
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,270
in relation to some of those applications.

914
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:55,750
But I guess the short answer is there

915
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,160
is no relationship at this point.

916
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,350
- Thanks, Tamara.

917
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,670
Sam Dempsey, would you like to come

918
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,770
off mute and post your question?

919
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,250
- Yeah, thank you.

920
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,010
So I'll just have the 15%.

921
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,520
That's a high yield for the

922
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,460
agricultural production industry.

923
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,230
When when we've looked at this

924
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:21,200
10 year period from 2007 to 2017.

925
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,130
Is there a filter that can be applied to look at the

926
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,940
land use change just to capture where remnant forest

927
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,100
has remained where it's potentially been cleared?

928
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,050
Or to be able to, I guess, benchmark how the industry

929
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,870
is positively contributing to land use change.

930
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,010
- Thanks, Sam.

931
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,390
So we are proposing a monitoring process

932
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:46,709
once we can get this map finalized.

933
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,500
But in terms of land use change in terms of like

934
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,730
the use of agricultural land particularly, and

935
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,549
you know, conversion to plantation timber or

936
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,120
some other type of carbon capture initiative.

937
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,879
It's not proposed at this stage

938
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,500
for this process to capture that.

939
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,610
The monitoring process that we're proposing is to be

940
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,710
able to understand how much of what we're identifying

941
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,429
as SSA l might be lost in any year to agricultural

942
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,180
production, whether that's through conversion to other

943
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,670
permissible uses in the rural areas like mining or

944
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:25,100
solar, or whether it's to urban encroachment and the

945
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,220
like, and then understanding why that has occurred.

946
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,120
You know, in, like we said, in

947
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,570
some cases that might be necessary.

948
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,220
But at this stage, we're not proposing a process.

949
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,519
As part of this map, at least, to be able to quantify that

950
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,819
land use management provisions, having said that, it will

951
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,200
be possible, looking at some of the data sets that O H and

952
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,950
API in the life use for the regulatory mapping, I think

953
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,100
that it would be possible and probably worthwhile doing.

954
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,030
But I have not got enough staff

955
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:54,600
or mind capacity at this stage.

956
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,329
To contemplate that for more than happy

957
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:58,589
if you want to provide that feedback.

958
00:50:58,629 --> 00:51:00,743
We're always looking at how we can improve the processes

959
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:03,220
and the decision making information that we have.

960
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:04,419
- Thank you.

961
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,460
I just had a follow up question.

962
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,430
I understand that you're saying that down the

963
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:13,009
line, you'd look to potentially include a second

964
00:51:13,009 --> 00:51:16,179
addendum to intensive livestock or looking at

965
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,070
the IPAS don't the timeline to that would be?

966
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,009
- I'd like to say yes.

967
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,100
But I really am.

968
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,149
I'm reluctant to commit like,

969
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,379
what it's going to depend upon.

970
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:30,160
So I have a team of seven staff.

971
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:33,040
And we have a series of projects that have come

972
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,409
out of the recommendations of the commissioner

973
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,410
as well as work that we do in terms of referrals,

974
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:41,120
and, you know, working with industry and the like.

975
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,640
So the IPAS project.

976
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,980
I love the IPAS project.

977
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,310
It's one of my favorites.

978
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,680
And I would love it to be occurring right now.

979
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,620
But I just can't resource that

980
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,430
while we're doing this project.

981
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,509
And then the other thing is, as well, I guess

982
00:51:55,509 --> 00:51:57,029
there's going to be some key learnings from this

983
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,330
project and the mapping data sets that we have in

984
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:02,820
the like, that will then inform the IPAS project.

985
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,830
And also the negotiations across government too.

986
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,576
So if if a decision is made across government that this

987
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:12,960
map has no regulatory effect, then the IPAS might not

988
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,549
benefit from being identified in this process only it may

989
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,210
well be that we identify them and apply them on a regional

990
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,790
scale, or we talk to council about their identification

991
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,980
and then recognition in their LPs at a regional scale.

992
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,210
So there's a lot of uncertainties at the moment

993
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,590
just based on the uncertainty around this mapping

994
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,480
process and how and how it's going to be applied.

995
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,569
And I note that there is some frustration in

996
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,440
some of the other questions in the chat around

997
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,780
the policy and, and how the maps to be applied.

998
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,500
And, you know, we're we're in sort of the same boat to

999
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,640
some extent as well, ideally, we would have known, and we

1000
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,710
would know by now what what the maps intended to inform

1001
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,799
and how much weight it's going to have in the like,

1002
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,209
but irrespective, we think there's a lot of value in

1003
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,850
mapping, what we consider state significant agricultural

1004
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,270
land, and we'll continue to run that process while

1005
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,759
that policy position is developed across government.

1006
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,420
Thank you.

1007
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,990
Thanks, Sam, Tamara.

1008
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,390
Kylie, if you could just put up the last slide again,

1009
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,470
I know we're getting close to the end of our time.

1010
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,620
Has anybody got a burning question they'd like to

1011
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,799
ask or can take a couple more from the chat if you've

1012
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,869
got something that you'd like to raise your hand?

1013
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,310
- One of the questions haven't from the chat

1014
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,240
related to identifying the criteria on the map.

1015
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,626
You know, like whether the, at the moment

1016
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,490
when you look at the map, it just uses.

1017
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,060
It's just blue shading over the land.

1018
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:53,490
And there's no indication of why that land

1019
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,630
has been shaded, you know, as alignment with

1020
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,640
the criteria that we you spoke to earlier.

1021
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,969
Could you talk to that point, please?

1022
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:03,169
I know, this was raised a couple of times.

1023
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,060
- Sure.

1024
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,760
The reason that we couldn't put up the data

1025
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,810
sets that's for the whole state with the

1026
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,349
underlying data that helped build it is too big.

1027
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:15,209
To be honest.

1028
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,380
It's close to over two gig.

1029
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,800
And so you wouldn't be able to move

1030
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,509
around or have a look on the map.

1031
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,609
If there's a particular area that you would

1032
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:29,419
like to get an understanding of what criteria

1033
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,480
has put it in on or knocked it out of SSL.

1034
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,623
Please provide a comment or send something through

1035
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:39,460
to the email address and we'll be able to provide

1036
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,839
some information after the exhibition period

1037
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:51,579
about the criteria that was used to determine it.

1038
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,639
- Thanks, Helen.

1039
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:57,480
So just to recap, public exhibition will be running

1040
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,150
into the 31st of January and also in the chat there was

1041
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,740
discussion about engagement with with the agricultural

1042
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,209
industry, we will be holding another webinar in early

1043
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:12,849
January, conscious of the fact that lots of farmers are busy

1044
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,210
with harvest at the moment and or struggling with floods.

1045
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,960
You can provide feedback by completing the survey or making

1046
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,660
a comment on the map, or providing written submissions

1047
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:32,580
by 31st of January to the SSA or feedback at dpi.

1048
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,550
Email address.

1049
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:37,430
And then once the exhibition is finished, will

1050
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,520
were we trawling through the submissions and

1051
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,900
looking at any necessary amendments to the map?

1052
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,350
Knowing that we are out of time there, we'll go

1053
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,549
through all the questions in the chat after this.

1054
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:55,190
And and if we do anything we haven't covered,

1055
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,349
we'll put a response to it in our Frequently Asked

1056
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,410
Questions section on our webpage and exhibition page.

1057
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,710
And so I think if this there's any last burning questions,

1058
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:15,019
if anyone wants to raise their hand and speak to or not

1059
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:21,100
call that call, close that webinar, they're certainly used

1060
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,980
to get your hand up, or is there anything else you want?

1061
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:26,780
Or something new you want to talk to?

1062
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:27,150
- Or not?

1063
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,020
I just left it up.

1064
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,940
But I just had a thought just following PowerPoint there.

1065
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,580
Could you Is there a way just to apply like a filter to

1066
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:40,459
just show like, one lens to the map, like you don't want

1067
00:56:40,459 --> 00:56:43,899
to I guess have six different colors coming off at once.

1068
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:46,139
At least if you could say, well, this is most

1069
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:48,439
applicable to me, this is what I'd like to say.

1070
00:56:50,649 --> 00:56:51,269
- I'm working investigate the different layers that

1071
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:55,690
we can put in but knowing that there's so many

1072
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,790
different criteria, it's hard to determine what

1073
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,850
different people may or may want to save themselves.

1074
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:06,350
So because it was built using a whole variety

1075
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:09,510
of different data sets that yeah, just it's

1076
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,729
just too large at this stage, so but yeah.

1077
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:17,279
- Thank you.

1078
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:18,289
Okay.

1079
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:18,879
Thanks, Sam.

1080
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:19,450
Thanks, Helen.

1081
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,100
Thank you all for attending today.

1082
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,510
Stay tuned on our exhibition page for updates

1083
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,846
and feedback, there's a area there where

1084
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:31,429
you can register for further information.

1085
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:37,906
And we already have a list of over 500 people,

1086
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:39,775
stakeholders here to email addresses that we can we

1087
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,510
can send invitations out to or more information out to.

1088
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,170
So yeah.

1089
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,520
- We've had quite a few questions coming up

1090
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,559
in the chat or try and address some of them.

1091
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,020
Now.

1092
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,960
A question about slope, Helen, and

1093
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:01,220
the data set used to identify slope.

1094
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:05,289
Could you talk somewhat where that

1095
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,749
that information has come from?

1096
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:13,169
- Yeah, so the data set that we used was, it's the same

1097
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:17,089
data set that was used for the native vegetation mapping.

1098
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,980
So identify as land that's above 18 degrees slope.

1099
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:26,319
So we've only made a cut off at 18 degrees at present.

1100
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,629
We also have a slope read that goes right across the state.

1101
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:32,550
And we will be looking at potentially using

1102
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:37,520
a lower threshold in future if 18 degrees

1103
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,895
is deemed too high for this particular map.

1104
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:43,940
- So if there's land appearing that people think is high

1105
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,299
is steeper than 18 degrees, let us know in the in the

1106
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,330
submissions or on the map, and then we can investigate that.

1107
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:57,700
nother question about intensive industries tomorrow.

1108
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,300
Would you like to tackle that one?

1109
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,840
Whether they've been accounted for in this process?

1110
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,359
- Yeah, no, and that's a great question.

1111
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,790
So and it's something I probably should

1112
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,140
have mentioned in the earlier slide.

1113
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,150
So I know, the intensive industries haven't

1114
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,020
been picked up in this mapping process.

1115
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,890
This process has been based purely

1116
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,239
on biophysical characteristics.

1117
00:59:18,339 --> 00:59:22,100
There's an intention to map what we're calling intensive

1118
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,170
production areas identified production areas, where we can

1119
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,589
look at where there are clusters of some type of development

1120
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:31,549
or alternatively, particular industries that need to be

1121
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,700
identified on a map and and have some type of level of

1122
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,079
consideration in the planning framework addition to this.

1123
00:59:38,089 --> 00:59:40,889
So it was decided to split the two to enable further

1124
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:43,770
work to be done for those industries is that enabled

1125
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:47,060
us to get the physical map out in an earlier stage?

1126
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,580
Just to make sure that we had some level of

1127
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,030
consideration of the biophysical characteristics

1128
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,900
while we go through a process of working out how we're

1129
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,080
going to deal with those industries that are not so

1130
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,949
reliant on like the intensive livestock and even some

1131
00:59:59,949 --> 01:00:02,029
of the The intensive cropping industries as well.

1132
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,600
So the agriculture commissioners report that

1133
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,529
was released, it had 13 recommendations.

1134
01:00:09,149 --> 01:00:12,919
And in those, there's recommendations around education,

1135
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:15,320
the identified production areas I spoke about, but

1136
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,680
also buffers and consideration as to whether there

1137
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,880
should be a mandatory consideration of buffers in

1138
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,220
the planning framework, when proposals are within

1139
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:27,570
proximity to existing agricultural enterprises, as well.

1140
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,930
And so as part of that process, we are currently having

1141
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,839
a look at reviewing our interim buffer guidelines to try

1142
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:35,429
and give them a bit more scientific rigor and strength.

1143
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,580
And then try and raise their profile a little

1144
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,440
in the planning framework as well to as

1145
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,140
another way of stopping land use conflict.

1146
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,020
Thanks, Mara, and the information that was

1147
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,119
collected with the important agricultural

1148
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,760
land process between 2017 and 2019.

1149
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:55,680
Can you talk how that was it that's

1150
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,779
been considered in this in this map?

1151
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:00,769
- Yeah.

1152
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,399
So the land the information that was collected as part

1153
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,870
of that process, looked at a couple of different facets.

1154
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:09,790
So it looked at some biophysical work, as well as collecting

1155
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:12,640
specific industry information for industries in those

1156
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,160
regions so that industry specific information in the regions

1157
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,170
will be helpful for informing that identify production areas

1158
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:22,550
project, and some of the biophysical information that we've

1159
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,450
collected helped us determine what some of the methodologies

1160
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,360
settings might be as part of this process as well.

1161
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,780
- There's a question about the relationship between

1162
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:38,399
assets, OFAC soils, we have been talking to other

1163
01:01:40,759 --> 01:01:44,089
sections of government, other agencies of government

1164
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,340
that do a lot of work in the SSL faceoff space.

1165
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,880
And we'll be working with them to make sure that our mapping

1166
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:56,640
correlates with what they know as well as a sulfate soils.

1167
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,569
Question tariqa, I just like to build on

1168
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:07,020
that one in that some of the low lying

1169
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:11,080
areas are used as quite good, daring lands.

1170
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,969
And so whether there's potential for assets or bad soils,

1171
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:20,861
if it's not disturbed, then we will keep that as SSA L.

1172
01:02:20,861 --> 01:02:22,830
I also just noticed that comments in relation

1173
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,199
to the the slope again, it's 18 degrees and 32%.

1174
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:24,228
So they're the same thing.

1175
01:02:24,228 --> 01:02:32,210
So I'm just clarifying that for those who

1176
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:34,410
were working between degrees and have you

1177
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:39,589
got on that always confuses me, I'm afraid.

1178
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,049
The question is a couple of questions relating to

1179
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:46,730
the relationship between SS map Sal and urban areas.

1180
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:51,940
There's in relation to existing urban areas, some of

1181
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:56,250
the SSA Oh, but that urban land and could potentially

1182
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,009
be considered as a issue with land use conflict.

1183
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:00,623
Tomorrow, would you like to talk to that?

1184
01:03:00,623 --> 01:03:06,150
And maybe how the SSA or map could assist in

1185
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,080
resolving land use conflict in the future?

1186
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:08,960
- Yeah.

1187
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,130
So the intention with this map is to

1188
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,450
identify the resource and where it is.

1189
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:17,999
So it may well be that does about urban land in some

1190
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,750
places, I actually think I saw some questions as well

1191
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,780
about identified urban growth areas and whether it was

1192
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:26,750
intended that the map overlay there and and now it's not.

1193
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,679
So if you do see any areas where we have included

1194
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,399
the mapping over identified urban growth areas,

1195
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,479
please let us know, because that's something

1196
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,850
that we can fix as part of the next iteration.

1197
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:40,400
But in terms of separation from existing urban growth

1198
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,240
areas, the issue will be if if we separate them that from

1199
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,060
those growth areas and set it out a bit further, those

1200
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,739
growth areas, because it's intended potentially to be used

1201
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,429
in the strategic framework, those growth areas, learning

1202
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:53,870
proach to the boundary, again, will then have to move

1203
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,190
that back again, and then again, they would encroach.

1204
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,810
So there's a risk of creep, unless we actually

1205
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,925
identify the resource and where it is at the moment.

1206
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,070
Now, it may well be that there is land use conflict,

1207
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,900
which would arise if there was a higher level of

1208
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,030
intensive production on the boundaries, and that would

1209
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,720
be have to be dealt with at a site specific level.

1210
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,650
But in terms of the actual resource, I think it's

1211
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:16,930
important to identify where it is not covering areas

1212
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:19,129
which have been identified for future urban release.

1213
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,040
But just to help guide with that future

1214
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:25,180
urban release might seat it tomorrow.

1215
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,079
Question from one on the council relating

1216
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,160
to the economic viability of land.

1217
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,580
This is something that they won't really rule lands

1218
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,950
committee has been very strong in advocating for.

1219
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:45,900
Could you talk about how the viability of land might be

1220
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:50,070
considered or isn't considered at this stage in the NSA?

1221
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:50,400
Oh, man.

1222
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,280
- Yeah.

1223
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:55,069
So I assume that the viability of land is a reference

1224
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,350
to the scale of the lots on how large some of them are.

1225
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,279
Yeah.

1226
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,699
So there's a whole heap of work been done in that

1227
01:05:00,759 --> 01:05:03,950
in that space at the moment across various councils

1228
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,040
where I'm where my daughter is bringing my phone,

1229
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:11,260
across various councils where, um, you know, there's

1230
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,390
a whole heap of existing fragmentation particularly

1231
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:18,479
in the coastal zones, and not mapping that land is Sal

1232
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,789
would mean that that land would again continue to be

1233
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:23,399
fragmented, whereas it might serve a useful purpose in

1234
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:27,260
facilitating some type of small lat intensive production.

1235
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,276
So whether it be like obviously intensive livestock might

1236
01:05:30,276 --> 01:05:32,319
not be suitable there, but it may well be suitable for

1237
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,589
share farming, some sort of emerging niche industry,

1238
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:38,540
there's a lot of emerging industries that don't require a

1239
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:42,850
lot of land, particularly on in the outskirts of townships.

1240
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,259
So cut flowers, for example, one, mushroom farming

1241
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,630
and the like, can occur on quite small lots.

1242
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,770
So I think there's a there is an issue with economic

1243
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:55,210
viability, but often councils turn to diversification

1244
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:59,070
into other non agricultural pursuits, like tourism and

1245
01:05:59,070 --> 01:05:59,461
the light within those landscapes and, and that then

1246
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:04,069
in turn, can prevent those lots actually being used, or

1247
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,509
adjacent to those lots of being used for intensive and

1248
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,770
agricultural purposes because of land use conflict reason.

1249
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,990
So if you've got an existing fragmented

1250
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:15,250
landscape, please talk to us.

1251
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,280
So we can work out what you know we can do to help you.

1252
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:20,720
Or if there is anything that we can do to help you

1253
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,890
to try and make sure that the best agricultural

1254
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:27,790
land remains in sort of productive use, while also

1255
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,740
ensuring that you know that you've got the room that

1256
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,640
you need for growth and whatever else it is, the

1257
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,050
council might envisage as their as their future.

1258
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:36,915
Sorry, but the short answer is no, no

1259
01:06:36,915 --> 01:06:36,999
consideration of economic some or the exclusion

1260
01:06:36,999 --> 01:06:37,082
of smaller existing lots at this stage.

1261
01:06:37,082 --> 01:06:37,118
- Thank you tomorrow.

1262
01:06:37,129 --> 01:06:48,529
I also know Brian, I think I saw your hand pop up.

1263
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,600
If people would like to speak to their questions.

1264
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,530
Ellison Did you please.

1265
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,240
Click on the reaction button down

1266
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,290
the bottom and raise your hand.

1267
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,860
And we'll try and get to you as well.

1268
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:05,359
Alison, do you still want to talk to your question?

1269
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,669
- Yes.

1270
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,450
My question was regarding how does the SSI Oh land

1271
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:16,580
interact with the state significant renewable energy

1272
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,110
mapping that way now in which central wastes are not as

1273
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,249
most buried under the state's significant agricultural

1274
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:26,759
land, but we're now been inundated by renewables?

1275
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,460
How will that interact so that we can coexist?

1276
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,120
- Thank you.

1277
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:34,609
It's a million dollar question.

1278
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:35,120
Allison.

1279
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,620
I'd be happy if you've got an answer to that.

1280
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:42,429
Look, we met with some of the proponents of some solid

1281
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,214
developments yesterday that are both mapped as Sal

1282
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:47,389
as well as being within the renewable energy zones.

1283
01:07:47,389 --> 01:07:50,560
And at this stage, the purpose and application

1284
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,160
of the map has not yet been finalized.

1285
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:56,130
So there is no clear mandate as to

1286
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,029
how his proposal should be considered.

1287
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:00,000
And each at the moment is currently being

1288
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,690
considered on its individual merits.

1289
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,230
So I think there's a we had a similar

1290
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:06,859
question in the webinar yesterday.

1291
01:08:06,859 --> 01:08:09,050
And, and there's a regulatory aspect to it,

1292
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,683
which is that the map does not have at this

1293
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,390
stage, a regulatory purpose in that space.

1294
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,870
But then there's a community sentiment purpose as well.

1295
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,750
And there's a fair bit of concern about

1296
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:21,000
social licence in the renewable energy zones.

1297
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:23,970
And the last thing that that we need in those

1298
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:26,040
zones is loss of social licence because of a

1299
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,349
perception of loss of, you know, the sustainability

1300
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,029
of an industry due to fragmentation or the like.

1301
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,019
So, look, it's a great question.

1302
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:36,529
And happy to talk to you more offline about that, because

1303
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,409
it's an area that, you know, we're working quite closely

1304
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:43,720
with planning in at the moment, and you're keen to try

1305
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,250
and get a resolution because there are competing interest

1306
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,690
entities driving divide at the moment across communities.

1307
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:52,009
- Thanks, tomorrow, we'll go back to

1308
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,240
a couple of questions from the chat.

1309
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,990
There's a couple of questions relating to whether

1310
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:57,620
urban and industrial land has been excluded.

1311
01:08:58,369 --> 01:09:03,699
It has but the zoning has been taken as of June 2020,

1312
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,370
I think in color from from memory, so any land that's

1313
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:14,029
been rezoned or industrial as urban or identified as an

1314
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:15,836
open release area, since then, may still be showing up

1315
01:09:15,836 --> 01:09:20,200
as being mapped as SSA L So, so if there are areas out

1316
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,430
there in your council, LGA that, you know, have been

1317
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,880
identified for urban purposes since then, let us know.

1318
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:31,769
And we will look at that with the next version of the map.

1319
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:36,290
Another question relating to how this map will feed

1320
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:40,259
into the North Coast Regional Plan and also the

1321
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:43,660
review of the Greater Sydney regional plan as well.

1322
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:46,580
Tomorrow, we'd like to talk to that issue.

1323
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,340
- Yeah.

1324
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:49,687
So there's a slight conflict of timing at the

1325
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:51,349
moment with the North Coast Regional Plan.

1326
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:54,829
So as I understand it, it's out on exhibition now

1327
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:57,570
or is it or about to go out on exhibition for review

1328
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,680
and at this stage, our map obviously is in its first

1329
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,959
iteration, and very much keen to hear your feedback

1330
01:10:04,179 --> 01:10:06,940
on how we can improve the map for the next iteration.

1331
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:11,190
But until this map is in a form where we're

1332
01:10:11,469 --> 01:10:14,360
more happy that it's accurate, it won't

1333
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,030
be used to replace any mapping product.

1334
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,840
And then, So following on from that the North

1335
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,180
Coast mapping, we'll continue to use the existing

1336
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,769
North Coast important agricultural land mapping,

1337
01:10:24,419 --> 01:10:26,699
important farmland mapping until such time as

1338
01:10:26,799 --> 01:10:29,739
this product is agreed to be a replacement for it.

1339
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:31,580
And its accuracy has been, you know,

1340
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,110
confirmed or at least accepted.

1341
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:37,176
So similarly, with the Sydney in the Sydney

1342
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,200
area, we did consider the use of the Metropolitan

1343
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,130
rural area as potentially entirely being mapped.

1344
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:45,420
But we did note that it picked up areas that

1345
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:48,450
were used for urban areas in the life as well.

1346
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:48,453
So we determined not to do that just because

1347
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:48,457
it would impact the ability to apply certain

1348
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:48,461
planning controls across the breadth of SSA L.

1349
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:48,465
The intention is, as I mentioned earlier, any existing

1350
01:10:48,465 --> 01:10:48,474
urban growth areas, or areas identified for future

1351
01:10:48,474 --> 01:10:52,889
growth purposes, should be excluded from our map.

1352
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:59,753
So please, if they're wrong, please identify them.

1353
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:09,990
But yeah, hopefully we'll be able to help better inform

1354
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,000
some of the planning in Sydney though there's been

1355
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,780
quite extensive planning down in that region and and

1356
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,080
particularly regionally specific planning as well.

1357
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,490
We know that there's issues with food deserts in Sydney,

1358
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,239
and even land that's not mapped as SSA Oh, we'll be able

1359
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:26,849
to help contribute to that region's food and fiber needs,

1360
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,230
as well as demonstrating and educating the community,

1361
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:31,290
the broader community down there around agriculture.

1362
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:34,830
- Thanks, Tamara.

1363
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:36,790
Hello, and a couple of questions

1364
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,550
about the functionality of the map.

1365
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:43,080
There was a point raised there that a comment

1366
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,600
made a little while ago hasn't shown up on a map.

1367
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:48,540
And also do people get notified when they when

1368
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,110
they comments when I make a comment on the map?

1369
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:55,200
- Yes, so we're getting quite a few

1370
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,150
comments come through, which is fantastic.

1371
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,539
That's the feedback that we're after.

1372
01:11:58,559 --> 01:12:02,460
So we they do get reviewed internally by

1373
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,340
dpi before they get put up on the map.

1374
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,990
So quite often a bit more of a genuine statement about

1375
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:13,110
them that then a feedback will go back via email to

1376
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,630
yourself and might not necessarily show up on the map.

1377
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:18,660
But you will certainly get notified for that.

1378
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:23,040
If it's a comment made on a particular area.

1379
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,500
So saying this area should or should not be included.

1380
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,669
That information goes up on the map for people to

1381
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:33,340
elaborate on or start a discussion, or like or dislike.

1382
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:38,370
So where it usually takes a few days to get

1383
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,910
through some of the comments, but definitely

1384
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,200
would get your you will get feedback.

1385
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,230
- Thanks, Alan.

1386
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:48,110
One other comment or question related

1387
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,919
to the the timeframe for exhibition.

1388
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,900
exhibition has been extended until

1389
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,539
the 31st of January next year.

1390
01:12:54,649 --> 01:12:57,150
So there's still time to to make submissions.

1391
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,280
Also, we been informed, but we

1392
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:03,870
will with the harvest requirements.

1393
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:05,019
And also with the flooding that

1394
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,990
we've had in western New South Wales.

1395
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:10,120
Just recently, many people who had registered have been able

1396
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,700
to make these webinars so we will be holding another webinar

1397
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:16,139
in early January with penciled in the 13th of January.

1398
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,460
So the information on that one and registration details

1399
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:23,349
will go up on our exhibition page in the next week or so.

1400
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:24,740
So look out for that.

1401
01:13:25,309 --> 01:13:27,900
If there's somebody you know, who wanted

1402
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,370
to attend, but hasn't been able to.

1403
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:36,170
Was there anybody else who wanted to raise their hand and

1404
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:40,179
speak to a question or any issues that are burning for them?

1405
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,129
- Might just raise mine quickly.

1406
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:43,740
Saudis.

1407
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:47,849
- Oh, sorry.

1408
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:48,269
Hey, Rhonda.

1409
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,970
I, did to actually if you can hear me, Amanda.

1410
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:52,340
Yes.

1411
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:52,840
Go ahead.

1412
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,370
Yes.

1413
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:56,460
It takes a little while for your for your name and

1414
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,239
image to pop up to the top of the to the screen for FTC.

1415
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:02,009
So yeah, go ahead.

1416
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:02,969
- Okay, thanks.

1417
01:14:03,339 --> 01:14:08,049
I'm disconcerted to hear that.

1418
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:12,190
If farmers alter the pH of their land to make

1419
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,269
the lane more productive, that is totally

1420
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:20,509
disregarded, because the lane might change hands.

1421
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:23,370
I mean, surely farmers should be encouraged

1422
01:14:23,609 --> 01:14:25,960
in increasing the productivity of the land

1423
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:31,469
and also encouraged to dryland farm in a very

1424
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:37,360
productive way by planting deep rooted legumes.

1425
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,620
no till farming.

1426
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:42,730
There's a lot of things that farmers can do with

1427
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,889
dryland farming that makes the land productive.

1428
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:47,990
Yes, I can see that that land is not

1429
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,799
recognized as being of significant value.

1430
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:55,999
I can see on the map and it's very significant.

1431
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:00,139
- Yeah, tomorrow, would you like to answer that question?

1432
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:01,000
- Yeah.

1433
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,770
So thanks, Amanda and look god, yeah, fully

1434
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:07,950
supportive of the use of regenerative or other farming

1435
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,230
methods, which do make the land more productive.

1436
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:13,770
And look, it would be great if we could recognize that.

1437
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:15,589
So the maps intended to be at this

1438
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,470
stage applied at a regional scale.

1439
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,850
Some of the underlying data sets are very

1440
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:23,410
limited in terms of the input layers being

1441
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:27,120
at like one to 100,000 map scales at best.

1442
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,990
So to go down to a cadastral level and see how poor farming

1443
01:15:32,259 --> 01:15:35,210
practices have improved, the landscape in particular areas

1444
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,140
would probably not work in terms of some of those other

1445
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,740
underlying data sets that we're having to use as well.

1446
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,530
It also means that we would end up with a

1447
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:44,809
landscape where we might have a well managed

1448
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:48,289
farm here and mapped and one here, not mapped.

1449
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,660
But that's not to say that we don't encourage

1450
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:53,559
productive farming practices, either.

1451
01:15:53,559 --> 01:15:56,380
The mapping of the land is SSA L is not meant to

1452
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,740
mean that the other land is not as productive mapping

1453
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,709
land, farmland by any stretch of the imagination,

1454
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,740
there's, there's certainly areas that are going to

1455
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,389
be used for dryland cropping, which might not be

1456
01:16:05,389 --> 01:16:08,070
mapped in those areas, which at this stage may be

1457
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,869
mapped, which potentially aren't productive at all.

1458
01:16:11,969 --> 01:16:14,580
Also, if you do know of areas of the landscape

1459
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,706
where things have been improved, put a note

1460
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,610
down, and we can have a look at that as well.

1461
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,499
Because I mean, it may well be that

1462
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,580
the underlying soil set isn't that bad.

1463
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,730
If it can readily be converted and and made more

1464
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,769
productive, then it may well be that we have an

1465
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:31,160
opportunity to move things around a little bit and

1466
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,950
include that land at the expense of some other land

1467
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,790
which may be mapped and isn't quite as productive.

1468
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:38,150
So we'd really love to know from you where they are.

1469
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,469
But we just can't guarantee that we can look at

1470
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:42,879
a cadastral scale at each of the of the farms

1471
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,479
and and say Your time has been managed well.

1472
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,549
And you know, and even if it did change hands

1473
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,930
just change hands would still be productive

1474
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:52,559
probably for a decade or so, before it did revert

1475
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,230
back to potentially what it might have been.

1476
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,440
So yeah, came to came to hear where they are.

1477
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,219
So we can see what we can do about that.

1478
01:16:58,219 --> 01:17:01,800
But just in terms of the scale of the mapping at this

1479
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,110
point, we can't look at it at an individual site basis

1480
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:09,810
to do that, you know, maybe in some future iteration or

1481
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,300
that the maps intended to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.

1482
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,260
We know that production methods change, there's climate

1483
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:18,939
change going on, you know, there's obviously acidification

1484
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:21,513
and changes in rainfall patterns, which I think have been

1485
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:23,660
in some of the other questions that have been up there.

1486
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,290
And so there's a, there's an understanding that the map

1487
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:29,170
will need to be updated on a fairly regular basis to as

1488
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:32,010
that information changes and better data becomes available.

1489
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:35,240
So you know, at some point, there may well be a

1490
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,770
resource where we can map to a cadastral ale or not.

1491
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,945
And I hope that we do get to that point, because that

1492
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,259
would be really helpful from a planning point of view.

1493
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,780
But yeah, at this stage, we just

1494
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,240
don't have the resource to do that.

1495
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,020
- Well, that's that's a shortcoming of the

1496
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,700
whole process, though, isn't really there yet.

1497
01:17:51,969 --> 01:17:55,230
I mean, you're making decisions really

1498
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:59,840
about the land that may be incorrect.

1499
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,809
- Yeah, so and so that's the point of

1500
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,870
having the map applied to cadastral.

1501
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:08,169
Sorry, at a regional scale to be to begin with before it

1502
01:18:08,179 --> 01:18:10,959
is recommended for any type of application at a DA scale.

1503
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:12,469
And it might never get to that point.

1504
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,985
So we recognize that there are

1505
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,030
those shortcomings in the mapping.

1506
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,120
But from a point from the planning point of view,

1507
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,110
and from the point of view of the consultation that

1508
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,180
that we did with the broader community, and with

1509
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,820
councils as well, we thought it would be better

1510
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,850
to have a product out there, that might be 80%.

1511
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:28,300
Right?

1512
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,269
To enable us to start a discussion as to whether there

1513
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:33,480
was a need in the planning framework to recognize

1514
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,679
agricultural land, we're seeing increasing amounts

1515
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:38,840
of agricultural lands converted to other uses.

1516
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,590
And it's a case of do we want to identify

1517
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,070
where we think the better agricultural land is.

1518
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:47,070
So we can, you know, ensure intergenerational productivity?

1519
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,360
Or do we say, Look, we're never going to have the

1520
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,529
data sets to be able to have it identified on a

1521
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,529
cadastral basis, so we just won't do anything.

1522
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:55,639
And I think that the better outcome is to have

1523
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,500
a map which isn't perfect, but could be made

1524
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,010
better over time, then to not have anything and

1525
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:01,980
not be able to influence the framework at all.

1526
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:05,740
- Thank you tomorrow.

1527
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,440
Katie, you met Robert to film AFI is got the handout.

1528
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:11,350
Katie, would you like to make?

1529
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:12,999
So ask you a question?

1530
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:14,679
- Thank you, Paul.

1531
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,880
Question, it's probably slightly out of scope of this

1532
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,600
particular consultation process, but just wondering what the

1533
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:25,610
future consideration is for land that's adjacent to a cell

1534
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:28,870
or B cell that might have beneficial services to that land.

1535
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:31,890
So I think we should put a comment in the questions there

1536
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:34,560
about land that could be providing ecosystem services

1537
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,959
like being an important biodiversity reservoir or could

1538
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,904
be important for water management of that Sal, is there.

1539
01:19:40,099 --> 01:19:41,809
I know it's not part of this particular map.

1540
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,390
But is there an intention to try and include those

1541
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,789
kind of adjacent services in future planning?

1542
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:51,940
- So I'm happy to take that one.

1543
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,200
And thanks for the question, Katie,

1544
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,830
and also for the question in the chat.

1545
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:56,670
Look, the intention.

1546
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:59,110
So the purpose of this map is to identify states if

1547
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,790
you're going agriculture, to land now, there's some

1548
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,930
levels in some areas in the rural landscape which

1549
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,840
serve multiple purposes, including environmental

1550
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,990
functions and whatever else the case may be.

1551
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,290
And but the you know, at some

1552
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:13,450
point they might be recognized.

1553
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:17,339
And I think, this process in an ideal in my ideal

1554
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,190
world, and it might not be the view of government,

1555
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,210
we haven't had those negotiations yet, but would

1556
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:23,890
be to identify those areas, which, you know, have

1557
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:27,390
a preferred future use for productive farm farming.

1558
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:29,710
And there's other areas of the landscape then which

1559
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:32,139
might be identified as having more of that rural

1560
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:34,400
landscape value, and they may be your environmental

1561
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,669
assets or an environmental management perspective.

1562
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:40,239
So I'm hoping that, that this map is the first in a series

1563
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:43,340
of maps or a series of processes where we can ensure that

1564
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,830
the rural landscape is identified for its multitude of

1565
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:49,470
functions in a similar way to the way that the residential

1566
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,210
areas and the industrial areas are segregated into

1567
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:55,790
this type of residential or this type of industrials.

1568
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:58,479
You know, it's a clear area of work that needs to be done.

1569
01:20:59,309 --> 01:21:01,210
And you know, and it would be great to be able to say

1570
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:03,580
these maps going to say this, you know, preferred future

1571
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:07,059
use here is Enviro, here, it's going to be landscape here,

1572
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,019
it's going to be prime and production, we just haven't

1573
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,240
again, got the resources to do that in this first pass.

1574
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,709
But certainly, I hope that this is the

1575
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:16,040
start of a larger process to better

1576
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,110
allocate the rural landscape to those uses.

1577
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,210
Thank you.

1578
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,310
And I just and I might just jump back.

1579
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:24,080
Sorry, Amanda, one thing I didn't mention in response

1580
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,070
to your earlier question, and just to allay concerns is

1581
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,900
that one of the proposals that we're looking at is that

1582
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:33,700
for a site on a site specific basis, people can request

1583
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,059
a review of this map if they think the land has been

1584
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:39,550
mapped, and it's impacting upon them, and they don't

1585
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:41,526
want their land mapped, or, alternatively, they want

1586
01:21:41,526 --> 01:21:44,470
their land that we're proposing to introduce a process,

1587
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:47,409
you know, once a map is finalized, where you can write

1588
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:49,550
to us and say, Hey, I don't think the mappings right?

1589
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:51,750
You know, I think you need to change it.

1590
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:52,629
And those are the reasons why.

1591
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:56,190
And we'll look at an individual basis at those requests,

1592
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,580
and then update the map accordingly as necessary.

1593
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,730
So I'm not sure if that sort of adds to that.

1594
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:01,889
But I guess it's probably a bit of

1595
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,710
important information to have as well.

1596
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:05,460
Yes.

1597
01:22:08,309 --> 01:22:08,629
Sorry.

1598
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:11,119
Sorry, how long?

1599
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,520
- Yeah, it's just building on what Tamara was saying.

1600
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,320
Yeah, a verification process will go Go ahead,

1601
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,490
which then will be reviewed by a team based on

1602
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:26,400
the input data that's supplied to help support it

1603
01:22:26,429 --> 01:22:29,170
either being included or not included in the map.

1604
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:33,740
Okay, thanks.

1605
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:34,559
Thanks.

1606
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,320
Hello, Sally Whitelaw.

1607
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,810
Would you like to ask a question?

1608
01:22:38,599 --> 01:22:38,879
- Yeah.

1609
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,550
Thanks, Paul.

1610
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,739
Look, it's just about the important fallen North

1611
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,759
Coast when I was born across to the new map.

1612
01:22:45,689 --> 01:22:47,320
So it looks as though for around Coffs

1613
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,780
Harbour there might have been some changes.

1614
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:51,640
So just curious, it's been hard to tell, because the

1615
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:55,490
scale, the curious if there have been changes underneath?

1616
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:00,710
And what methodology that that changes might have been made?

1617
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:03,380
Ellenwood, would you like to start on that one?

1618
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:08,210
Yeah, so the North Coast family mapping was an

1619
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,290
input data layer that was brought in as a whole.

1620
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,570
Then there was also areas in the north coast that

1621
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:19,089
were identified using the statewide criteria.

1622
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:20,820
So that might not necessarily be

1623
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,350
picked up in the farmland mapping.

1624
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,260
So the new areas that you're saying is

1625
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:33,256
based on the criteria for the whole site.

1626
01:23:33,256 --> 01:23:41,780
Okay, tomorrow, there's a question in relation to the

1627
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:44,660
future timeframes for further iterations of the map,

1628
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,870
and whether councils will be able to, or whether anybody

1629
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:51,260
will be able to provide further comments at a later date.

1630
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,559
Can you talk to that issue face?

1631
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:54,870
- Yeah, definitely.

1632
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,305
So we're hoping to have the next iteration of the map out.

1633
01:23:55,305 --> 01:24:03,380
We were hoping initially for April, April, May.

1634
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,910
So we'll still say that we're aiming

1635
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,710
for April or May for the next iteration.

1636
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,909
And we're hopeful that by then we will have a policy

1637
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,089
position that we can exhibit at the same time.

1638
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:16,040
So we can get feedback on both the map within the

1639
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:19,770
context of how it is proposed, to potentially be applied.

1640
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:23,030
And, and there was some concern, I also saw in, in

1641
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:26,500
the commentary about its application or cadastral

1642
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,539
basis, initially, look, I just don't see that being

1643
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:33,169
its first application, I think we want to have a

1644
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:36,089
fair level of comfort at regional basis before we

1645
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:39,280
apply it, you know, mandatorily or cadastral basis.

1646
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,260
So look, I'm not going to guarantee that's not

1647
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:44,424
going to happen, but I'm quite confident in that

1648
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,370
the map will be applied, potentially in a strategic

1649
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,599
framework first, just to make sure councils

1650
01:24:49,599 --> 01:24:52,269
are happy with that, and landowners as well.

1651
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:54,503
But definitely there's a proposal that will

1652
01:24:54,503 --> 01:24:56,540
exhibit the policy and the map in sort of

1653
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,180
April May next year is its next iteration.

1654
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:02,180
- Thank you, Tamara.

1655
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:07,149
Helen point was made in the comments about federal Gramer

1656
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:11,599
photo grim Gramma tree and multispectral imagery and

1657
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:14,469
the use of that type of technology to inform the map.

1658
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:19,110
I'm hoping that you can talk to those

1659
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:20,820
issues rather than good, I can't.

1660
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,249
Can you give us a rundown on whether those type

1661
01:25:24,349 --> 01:25:28,059
of things can be used or how that fits into the

1662
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,229
public, publicly available data that we've used?

1663
01:25:31,019 --> 01:25:35,790
- Yeah, thanks for those data sets are very useful for looking

1664
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:39,410
at picking up different land management and other criteria.

1665
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:43,299
Definitely, it's, it's a bit of a challenge

1666
01:25:43,299 --> 01:25:47,610
to use them over a full statewide application.

1667
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,160
So currently, we just use the statewide information

1668
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:53,785
that's publicly available at this stage, because we know

1669
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:56,120
that there'll be a verification process down the track.

1670
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:01,280
We've also just started this process with a preliminary map.

1671
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:04,820
And depending on the resources that we have available,

1672
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:07,200
we'll look at other data lines that we can fit in.

1673
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,009
But certainly, if we can use some infrared

1674
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,610
and other other satellite imagery, that that

1675
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:16,889
would be fantastic to help with accuracy.

1676
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:20,160
But it will depend on what resources we have available.

1677
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:22,129
- Thanks.

1678
01:26:22,799 --> 01:26:26,530
And I think that that issue of having the most up to date

1679
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:30,540
information, or building a map based on the information

1680
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,810
we have to hand, it is also demonstrated in another

1681
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:37,260
comment in the in the chat there that at the moment,

1682
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:41,460
the best we've got is a five meter pixel rate faster

1683
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:45,769
for the for the slope lands, but there is a new, sorry,

1684
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:48,173
we've got a 30 meter pixel raster for the slope layers,

1685
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:50,509
but there's a new five meter one coming out next year.

1686
01:26:50,509 --> 01:26:52,590
So so that's the type of information we were

1687
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,180
looking for in in the, in our submissions, as well

1688
01:26:56,210 --> 01:27:00,639
from other agencies is, is where you have more

1689
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:03,180
or better information that can inform this map.

1690
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:06,610
We'd love to be able to use that so that

1691
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,410
we can make it as accurate as possible.

1692
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:10,250
Yeah.

1693
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:12,840
When when is finalized.

1694
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:18,320
Tomorrow there was a question about cropping versus grazing.

1695
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:22,980
In the in the chat there, the a lot of

1696
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,950
land looks like to be favoring the cropping

1697
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:30,120
land, whereas grazing can be occur on land.

1698
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,920
It's not necessarily mapped on the map as SSI.

1699
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:36,319
Oh, would you like to talk to that issue, please?

1700
01:27:37,109 --> 01:27:38,009
- Yeah, absolutely.

1701
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:42,720
So there's the reason that we've picked Well, the reason

1702
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:46,940
that the map is current, currently covering cropping, or

1703
01:27:47,469 --> 01:27:50,139
land that he's perceived to be able to promote cropping

1704
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:54,390
as opposed to grazing country is that as you've pointed

1705
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,290
out, in the question, grazing can occur for animals on a

1706
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:59,849
on a wide variety of soils and a wide variety of slopes.

1707
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:03,850
So cropping, however, is limited to only those areas,

1708
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:06,149
which, you know, are suitable for cropping, you know,

1709
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:09,460
fairly flat, fairly clean access to water and the like.

1710
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:13,469
So the intention is to identify land, which is of state

1711
01:28:13,469 --> 01:28:16,030
significant salt provides an economic return to the

1712
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:18,889
state, some of our key export industries and the like.

1713
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,900
And then can be used for a variety of purposes as well.

1714
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:24,779
So I've got some country here that I'm looking out over

1715
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:27,500
at the moment that has been cropped in the past, at

1716
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:30,260
the moment, we're using it for fattening at some point,

1717
01:28:30,309 --> 01:28:32,820
we might turn it back into cropping land, but it's

1718
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:35,200
good enough, but it could be used for both purposes.

1719
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,900
So we're grazing country is important.

1720
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:40,240
And certainly, you know, we've got a breeding

1721
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,290
enterprise as well, that uses slopey land,

1722
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:43,860
that wouldn't be any good for fattening.

1723
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,320
Also we couldn't crop it.

1724
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:45,614
So while it's important to recognize that, you know,

1725
01:28:45,614 --> 01:28:50,610
grazing, sorry, having breeding country is important

1726
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:53,660
to any cattle operation, it's also important that we

1727
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,890
identify the land that can be used for a multitude

1728
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:59,889
of uses, because if we identified all of the country,

1729
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:02,660
you know, across the state or a larger proportion

1730
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,730
of it, we couldn't have targeted planning controls.

1731
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:07,010
And the intention behind the map is that we enable

1732
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,310
it to be used in the planning framework to have a

1733
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,700
stricter array of planning controls, potentially, or at

1734
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,260
least a higher level of consideration for agriculture.

1735
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,939
And then there would be other areas of the rural landscape,

1736
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,919
which are still considered agricultural lands, but maybe

1737
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:24,009
I will to do additional things, you know, which may be

1738
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:27,180
slightly incompatible, then the higher intensity uses

1739
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:29,900
that might occur on the land that's mapped as Sal, I

1740
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,710
know, that's a long Wofully answer to your question, but

1741
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,910
effectively, it's about having, you know, quite a targeted

1742
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:39,219
subset, which is supported by those other lands as well.

1743
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,309
And as I've sort of said earlier, we're not walking

1744
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:43,340
away from the remainder of the rural landscape it's

1745
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:46,360
critical, you know, as a nursery and whatever else it

1746
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,460
might be, whether it's for cattle, sheep, or the like.

1747
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:51,690
We know fine grain wall is grown, you know, on some

1748
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:54,339
sleepy country and poor country, but we just can't

1749
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,539
identify all of the land so we had to identify

1750
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,919
that land which could serve both both purposes.

1751
01:30:00,879 --> 01:30:01,650
- Thank you, Tamara.

1752
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:07,420
question relating to notification of landowners, a

1753
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:13,120
lot of rural landowners don't have internet access.

1754
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:16,010
And so viewing the map will be difficult.

1755
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:19,720
We hadn't intended to write to all landowners

1756
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:22,860
in the state, which state government or

1757
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,390
DPI doesn't have the that information.

1758
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:28,470
But we're quite happy for councils to.

1759
01:30:30,969 --> 01:30:34,030
Not to write to people, but to help spread the word.

1760
01:30:34,219 --> 01:30:37,200
If they have newsletters, and we

1761
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,920
can talk to individual landowners.

1762
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:46,209
If they Yeah, they can't access the map that we have there.

1763
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:48,179
We're just we've got about four minutes left of our time.

1764
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:51,450
Is there any other question that someone would like to

1765
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,879
speak to that they have that we haven't covered yet?

1766
01:30:54,879 --> 01:30:56,410
We've had a lot of questions there in the chat.

1767
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,740
And I've frantically been trying to cover them all.

1768
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:00,550
But I'm admit, I probably missed a couple.

1769
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:04,360
Is there anything anybody would like to ask Kirsty?

1770
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:12,730
Just have to come off mute Kirsty, we can see I can

1771
01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:15,509
see your hand right, that says sorry, clicked it

1772
01:31:15,509 --> 01:31:17,400
but it didn't take but I'm just wondering what the

1773
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:21,250
timeframe is for including intensives and what the

1774
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,339
process is and how we get involved in the conversation.

1775
01:31:25,659 --> 01:31:27,830
- So yeah, so Kirsty, we're very much in

1776
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,239
early stages of that process at this stage.

1777
01:31:31,269 --> 01:31:33,989
And I would really would really welcome

1778
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,869
any input that we can have to that, when we

1779
01:31:36,869 --> 01:31:38,719
get to a point where we can take feedback.

1780
01:31:38,989 --> 01:31:41,273
Look, I envisage that that process won't commence,

1781
01:31:41,273 --> 01:31:45,699
you know, with any real vigor until probably 2023

1782
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:49,460
at a guess, just because we're nearly in 2022.

1783
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,390
Now, and it's going to take us I suspect

1784
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:53,230
most of next year to finalize this map.

1785
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,990
I have quite a small team.

1786
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:58,150
And we are working quite hard to try and get this

1787
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:00,219
map as well as some of the other components, the

1788
01:32:00,219 --> 01:32:02,330
education components and other components that

1789
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:05,730
are sort of recommended for us to undertake done

1790
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:09,059
so look very keen to have input from anyone that

1791
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,290
wants to give it to us in relation to that process.

1792
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:15,143
So if you wanted to send us your your details

1793
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,366
cosi, we're happy to put you on a list.

1794
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:19,160
You know, we're going to have steering groups and

1795
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,329
project committees on the like for that project.

1796
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:22,230
So really keen.

1797
01:32:22,609 --> 01:32:24,179
If you want to be involved in that.

1798
01:32:24,179 --> 01:32:25,836
That'd be great.

1799
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:26,880
Thank you.

1800
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:28,930
- Thank you, Kirsty.

1801
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:29,760
Thank you, Tamara.

1802
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:35,429
Carly, could we just put up the feedback slide, please,

1803
01:32:36,339 --> 01:32:39,260
- Mark, just that quickly there, Paul, just to further

1804
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,569
build on some of the things Tamara has mentioned it.

1805
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,700
This map is designed to look at the best of the best

1806
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:47,300
land, so it's not picking up particular industries.

1807
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:50,590
So just want to emphasize that the critical industry

1808
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:54,089
clusters that are identified as part of the cell, which

1809
01:32:54,089 --> 01:32:57,330
is within the mining sector, this will not replace that.

1810
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:02,603
So that's the viticulture CIC nv f1 CIC.

1811
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:03,850
- Thanks, Colin.

1812
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:06,263
So just just a reminder for the feedback public

1813
01:33:06,263 --> 01:33:09,530
exhibition is open to the 31st of January.

1814
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,550
As we mentioned, there'll be another

1815
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:14,550
webinar in early January, keep an eye on

1816
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:16,890
the on the social pinpoint site for that.

1817
01:33:18,309 --> 01:33:20,270
You can provide feedback by completing the

1818
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:22,900
survey or putting a comment on the map.

1819
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:26,263
The functionality of the map, being able to drop comments

1820
01:33:26,263 --> 01:33:28,980
onto your particular parcel of land is really good.

1821
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,959
So while you're in there, zooming

1822
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:32,009
around, having a look at it.

1823
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:35,680
Give us give us your feedback on your land as well.

1824
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:38,500
And of course, we'll take written submissions

1825
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:38,754
until the 31st of January, as well as

1826
01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:44,900
the SSA or feedback at DPI email address.

1827
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,034
Once we have all that those submissions and the

1828
01:33:46,034 --> 01:33:46,040
exhibition periods, close, we'll work through them

1829
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:56,280
all, we'll look at all the data that we have any

1830
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,860
new data that we can use to make the map better.

1831
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:04,519
And we will look at you know, tomorrow said

1832
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:06,850
looking at doing another version of the of the

1833
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,769
map for exhibition in April May of next year.

1834
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:15,650
So it was it is no other burning questions.

1835
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,390
Anybody has a notice?

1836
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:19,790
- Oh, can I just add one more thing?

1837
01:34:20,030 --> 01:34:22,120
And he's just asking that in the question about to

1838
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,569
what extent councils will have a say in the maps versus

1839
01:34:24,669 --> 01:34:28,250
owners in broadacre areas and both parties will have

1840
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:32,280
equivalent say so if you could please provide any feedback.

1841
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,070
Both councils and landowners have the same

1842
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:37,980
pathways to make comments to us on the map.

1843
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,429
And certainly we value the input of landowners

1844
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,010
because you know your country and you know, you know

1845
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:45,429
what it takes to run it so please don't hold back.

1846
01:34:45,469 --> 01:34:46,224
Let us know what you think.

1847
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,430
And that way we can try and get the best product

1848
01:34:48,469 --> 01:34:51,870
that's gonna serve industry which is you know,

1849
01:34:51,870 --> 01:34:54,309
what we're about as much as being able to make

1850
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:56,010
sure there's a good planning outcome as well.

1851
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,730
- Yeah, and then if they We'll be going through all the

1852
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:03,855
questions in the chat over the next couple of days.

1853
01:35:03,855 --> 01:35:05,819
And as I said earlier, anything that we

1854
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:08,052
haven't addressed, we'll make sure it goes

1855
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:11,780
into the FAQ is on our exhibition website.

1856
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,269
So with that, I thank you all for your attendance today.

1857
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,010
And we'll wrap up the webinar there.

1858
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,120
Thank you very much, everyone.
