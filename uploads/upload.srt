1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,550
S1: All right, so welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,380
Let's get the party started.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,730
So just so everybody understands
what the session is about.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,728
You know, I thought I'd just open
up a little opportunity so students

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
could not just read
the information about assessment,

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,370
too, but also hear a little
bit of an explanation or

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,430
a little bit of a background
on assessment, too.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,510
And what we are expecting
from the students

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,360
and that we hope that students start

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,500
working on this assignment
as soon as possible,

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,760
if you haven't started already.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,440
So I'm just going to show you some slides.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,010
I know that I showed this these slides to

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,890
the students who are fully online already.

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,810
I did add a little bit more information
and hopefully everybody will

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,460
have questions at the end, because
that's the point of today.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,750
It is asking questions, getting all your

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,050
doubts out of the way and having a clear

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,610
understanding of what you can do to
do really well in this assignment,

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,010
because I believe everybody can
do very well in this assignment.

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,350
So just explain what the assignment is.

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,069
We call it the muscle resource assignment.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,350
It's a muscle resource
because we want it to

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,380
be something that students can go back to,

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,940
to study, refresh their memory, recall,

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,970
or even use it to teach others anatomy.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,860
Because remember, as
a health professional,

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,110
you will be teaching
clients about anatomy.

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,260
You'll be helping them
understand their body better.

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,760
So if you have a resource that
could help them understand,

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,650
then that's even better.

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,220
And that's why we say
that this assignment,

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,060
it has to be something that's
useful for your future studies.

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,160
It can't just be something that you create

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,300
and then you're going to chuck away.

36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,301
That's not useful.

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,320
You know, we don't want to waste
anybody's time here in this unit.

38
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,020
We would like that every
effort that you make is

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,419
for learning and it's
for useful information.

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,680
The muscle resource
assignment has two parts.

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,280
The first part is
an individual assignment.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,580
And the second part is a group assignment.

43
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,740
And that's why we asked you to form groups

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,810
if you haven't formed a group yet,

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,760
because your tutorial is either
later today or tomorrow.

46
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,550
Don't worry, you'll still have
an opportunity to form a group.

47
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:36,630
But anyway, I'll start talking
about the parts of the assignment.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,220
And the individual part is what
we call the written component.

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,419
So the written submission
and this is the part

50
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,060
of the assignment that
I've been encouraging

51
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,230
students to create since
pretty much since week two,

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,540
since we, too, have been saying now,

53
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,910
everybody, if you're going
to watch the lecture

54
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,460
chunks on movements of the pelvis,

55
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,740
just create really great notes,

56
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,590
really great notes on
the movements of the pelvis.

57
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,850
And that means you add all
the regions of the the muscle regions,

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,370
then add which muscles are
part of these muscle regions,

59
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,940
and then describe the characteristics
of each of these muscles.

60
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,090
And the main characteristics
are always action,

61
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,060
attachment and innovation.

62
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,040
And then also show some
understanding of this concept,

63
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:29,610
how you apply this information.

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,220
So, for example, how are these muscles

65
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,610
contracting during a certain movement,

66
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,910
contracting concentrically,
contracting eccentrically,

67
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,630
or how do they engage in
a certain exercise or

68
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,730
maybe do a little bit
of a movement analysis?

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,300
So those those are
the things that we do in class,

70
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,520
and that's what we want to see
presented in your assignment.

71
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,536
We want to see if you understand how
to apply anatomical information.

72
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,830
So that's the written component.

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,990
You know, we did ask
everybody to do a muscle

74
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,720
resource for everything in this unit.

75
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,370
But you will only submit one topic
and I'll talk about the topic later,

76
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,580
because there are three different topics.

77
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,920
But the second part of your
assignment is a group component.

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,430
So that means the groups that
you form in your tutorial,

79
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,790
that is the group that
you will work with so

80
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,400
that you can create a five minute video.

81
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,779
And this five minute video can be,
you know, give or take 30 seconds.

82
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,029
It doesn't have to be
precisely five minutes,

83
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,450
but definitely not over
five minutes and a half.

84
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,010
Not under four minutes and a half.

85
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,690
And in this video, what
we would like to see

86
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,650
are all of the group members joining,

87
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,000
combining their topics
and doing a movement analysis

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,978
of a certain movement,
an exercise or an occupation.

89
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,290
So it's really up for you to decide within

90
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,210
your group what you would like to analyze.

91
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,669
And when we talk about analyzing
a movement or analyzing an action,

92
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,690
we are talking about everything
that we do in the tutorials.

93
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,250
So in the tutorials, you know, we
normally identify where the joints

94
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,239
are and then we talk about
the muscles that perform movements.

95
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,851
And these movements happen in
the Cardinal Plains and axes of movement.

96
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,330
So that would be the planes in the axes.

97
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,110
And then it would also be
good to also describe, again,

98
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,020
what type of contraction is
happening in these movements.

99
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,360
So you see, there are quite a few things

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,029
that I did there for movement analysis.

101
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,680
You needed to indicate joint muscles.

102
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,210
Where they move, moving planes
and axes, types of contraction.

103
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,410
And if you're doing an exercise,
if it's an open chain

104
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,670
kinetic exercise or close
kinetic chain exercise.

105
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,150
So those are that's how you
would do the movement analysis.

106
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,440
It's essentially the same kind of
activity that we do in the tutorials.

107
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,510
But when I said combine topics,

108
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,940
that means that if you're
analyzing a movement,

109
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,430
somebody will have to
analyze the lower limb,

110
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,290
the other person have to analyze a trunk,

111
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,140
and the last person will have
to analyze the upper limb.

112
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,440
OK, so you're combining these
together to analyze a movement,

113
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,550
because every movement would
involve all parts of your body.

114
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,010
You know, you can't separate your body.

115
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,860
So even if one part is
stagnant, for example,

116
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,500
if you're going to analyze somebody
who is in the sitting position,

117
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,100
still describe what is
happening in the lower limbs.

118
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,635
And if that means that, you
know, the joints are just.

119
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,339
Just staying in one certain position in

120
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,040
the muscles are relaxed and that's it,

121
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,540
and that's the movement analysis
of that part of the body.

122
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,650
And so just to keep it really
clear about what we're going

123
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,220
to be looking at in the written
individual assignment,

124
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,350
we hope to see the information that
we normally cover in the labs.

125
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,900
OK, so that's it.

126
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,440
The muscles in their characteristics
and in the video component,

127
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,439
we hope to see the concepts
that we cover in the tutorials.

128
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,660
Right, so that's that's how
I would divide it very clearly

129
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,760
about what we expect to
see in both of them.

130
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,760
And again, all your assignments
relate to your classes,

131
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,750
and that's why coming to class
is essential right now.

132
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,700
What are the objectives
of this assignment?

133
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,980
You know, we obviously
want to make sure that

134
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,330
all the information that you include

135
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,289
is accurate and that you demonstrate
how to apply anatomical knowledge.

136
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,900
And then you also demonstrate
that you understand

137
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,080
the function of all these
structures that we covered,

138
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,720
because by now you would
say that, you know,

139
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,940
the functions are you know,

140
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,760
some muscles are prime movers
or they're synergize or they're

141
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,756
stabilizers and or they are
involved in certain exercises,

142
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,040
certain movements.

143
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,790
So that that's that's how you
would demonstrate functionality.

144
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,780
And that obviously it is an assignment.

145
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,660
So it does need to be structured.

146
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,770
It doesn't need to follow like
a very specific formatting,

147
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,660
but it does need to be structured in
a way that is clear to understand,

148
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,250
because just remember that
your marker will be reading

149
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,580
your assignment and it needs
to be easy to follow,

150
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,050
because if it's all over the place,

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,630
obviously that's not going to demonstrate

152
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,920
much knowledge or it's just
going to be incomprehensible.

153
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,100
So structure and formatting are things

154
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,080
that in general in every assignment,

155
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,980
it's just worth taking your
time and doing those properly.

156
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,710
And to help you understand
a little bit more details

157
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,170
like what are we looking
for in your assignment?

158
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,030
So let's just start with
the rubric for the muscle resource.

159
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,440
So that's the written component.

160
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,140
So in in your assessment, two fold there.

161
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,280
If you go into Blackbaud assessment
assessment to in this folder,

162
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,290
you have a lot of
information there already.

163
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,420
So I hope you already read all
the information in there.

164
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,490
And one bit of the information that you

165
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,200
have in there is the market rubric.

166
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,208
You have a marketing rubric
for the muscle resource,

167
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,220
the written component,

168
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,390
and you also have a marketing rubric
for the video and marking rubric.

169
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,000
They pretty much describe everything that

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,929
we expect to see in your assignment.

171
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,150
So we're actually telling you what
you can include in your assignment,

172
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,130
because those are the things that
we're going to be looking for.

173
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,929
And that's exactly what
I just talked about.

174
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,380
We can be looking for if it's accurate.

175
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,030
If you understand how to
apply anatomical concepts,

176
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,490
if you understand how to
relate that to functionality,

177
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,990
and that means, you know, if you
if you really demonstrate that,

178
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,400
you're able to describe and into.

179
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,200
Also creates information that
you're not just somebody who's

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,390
copying and pasting information
from other places,

181
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,590
like you're actually demonstrating that

182
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,330
you can create your own diagrams,

183
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,309
you can create your own
pictures, illustrations.

184
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,700
So that would be the functionality bit.

185
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,140
And lastly, the structure
and form and formatting.

186
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,500
And I just want to point out a few
things that are very important.

187
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,480
So I hope everybody's paying attention now

188
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,580
because this is this gets lost sometimes.

189
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,940
And that the format that
we would like you to

190
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,530
submit this assignment
is as a PDF file PDF.

191
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,940
And now some students ask me, why
can't I submit it any other way?

192
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,460
Like, why can't I submit
it is the PowerPoint

193
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,940
or as a word file or any other way?

194
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,870
I'm going to say that PDF apps
are actually the way that is

195
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,750
just the easiest to keep
the formatting of your assignment,

196
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,240
because sometimes when
we open on turn it in

197
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,950
or when you open it on
a different computer,

198
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,512
you're format can go seriously off,
because I may not have the same

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,780
program as you do or the same
version of the program that you do.

200
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,429
And it really messes up the formatting.

201
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,280
But if it's a PDF, nothing changes.

202
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,100
It's still the same that you submitted.

203
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,000
So you're pretty sure that
you know what you submitted.

204
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,230
So PDF is is the most.

205
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,500
It's the only format that we will accept

206
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,780
the muscle resource written component.

207
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,220
Make sure that you identify
yourself in this PDF.

208
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,110
That means you need to include your
name, your student I.D., this unit,

209
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,086
which is functional anatomy, and
the code is hech umb one zero zero two.

210
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,880
Notice that for the written component on

211
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,500
the topic that you're going to submit,

212
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,720
there is a 30 page limit.

213
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,030
OK, so that means that please do
not extrapolate and buy 30 pages.

214
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,250
I mean, a four pages, which
is the most customary size,

215
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,730
because honestly, you don't
need more than that.

216
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,300
You know, most of the better
assignments that I've seen

217
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,510
in these years that we've
been doing this assignment,

218
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,520
I most of the better assignments are about

219
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,820
15 pages long or even less sometimes,

220
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,520
but they definitely don't need to be 30.

221
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,540
I feel that once it gets
to 30 and above becomes

222
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,820
very messy and becomes very loose,

223
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,850
information like the information doesn't
really connect with each other,

224
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,030
and it's just not that useful again,

225
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,710
because if you have the muscle
research that's over 50 pages long,

226
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,720
then, well, it's hard to find
the information, isn't it?

227
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,750
So it has to be something
that's quick and easy to see.

228
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,320
So 30 page limit.

229
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,260
There is no lower limit.

230
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,220
If you manage to I don't know
if you want to create, for example,

231
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,214
a huge info graphic or if you want
to create just a big poster, then.

232
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,090
Yeah, that's what you're going to submit.

233
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,059
And it's just one one page.

234
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,074
Right.

235
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,559
Just make sure that we're able to zoom in

236
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,470
and read it to just remember structure

237
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,429
formatting does mean readability as
well, as I put up here, readability,

238
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,280
because some students, sometimes they have

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,380
taken pictures of their assignments

240
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,679
and the picture quality is so poor that

241
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,480
we actually cannot read what's on it.

242
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,670
And if we can't read what's on it,

243
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,190
we can't really measure
any of these things,

244
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,000
we can't measure for accuracy
or application or or functionality.

245
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,070
And then students miss
out on all the marks

246
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,350
because they took really bad pictures.

247
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,590
So be aware that as
long as we can read it,

248
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:02,330
as long as it's organized
in a logical manner.

249
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,225
Properly identified, not over
30 pages, but no lower limit.

250
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,830
And also, obviously, it
has to be evidence based.

251
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,280
Because we don't think
that it's appropriate

252
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,030
to use incorrect information.

253
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,850
OK, I see a picture that I was
asked that's a good question.

254
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,650
So the the 30 page limit is per person.

255
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,850
It's per individual.

256
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,090
Because remember that this
part of the assignment

257
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,410
is an individual assignment.

258
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,350
You're going to submit it individually
through your own Turnitin portal.

259
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,480
You're not going to have to
submit it for the rest of

260
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,240
your group and you're not
going to have to combine.

261
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,830
This component of the muscle resource,

262
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,400
you're just going to submit
it yourself under 30 pages.

263
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,370
Yes, the 30 pages includes the references,

264
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,070
as I said, you really don't need 30 pages.

265
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,610
OK, so I try to keep it more concise,

266
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,350
try to keep it in a way that you
can clearly see everything.

267
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,840
Yeah.

268
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,390
So try to try to do it that way.

269
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,280
But each individual have a 30 page limit.

270
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,260
And that's it.

271
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,090
It must contain a reference list.

272
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,220
And citations, everybody citations,
INTECH citations, you know,

273
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,200
when you write down the information next

274
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,500
to the to the you have a paragraph

275
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,380
and you have to write down where
you got that information from.

276
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,610
So it's usually the author's
last names and a year date.

277
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,230
You do need to have that for
some of the information,

278
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,880
but not all the information.

279
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,380
So I'm going to say which ones you needed

280
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,547
for and which ones don't need it for.

281
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:49,660
Again, this is important.

282
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,860
So pay attention.

283
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,312
You do need to have InTech citations
for things than if you looked up.

284
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,030
Also, if you looked up
somewhere, you know,

285
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,020
in a textbook or if you looked up
in a scientific journal article,

286
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,370
if you looked at the website,
just reference them,

287
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,130
you know, you use it that information.

288
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,260
However, there are some information
that are the same everywhere.

289
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,030
So, for example, muscle's
the characteristics of the muscles.

290
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,316
So muscle attachments,
actions and innovation.

291
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,270
Those are the same in most
of the resources out there.

292
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,820
So I don't need you to reference them

293
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,020
because they're going to be the same.

294
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,070
And don't worry about keeping them
in the same structure either,

295
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,710
because it's going to there's going
to be a lot of the same thing.

296
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,530
So that can't be considered plagiarism.

297
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,240
If you write down the correct
attachments, action and innovation,

298
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,670
those things are probably going
to be the same everywhere.

299
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,590
But they're essential information to have

300
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,590
so that you do not need to reference.

301
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,628
You do not need to.

302
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,980
But everything else you do
need to cite in reference.

303
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,530
You need to cite everything
else that you include.

304
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,930
So, for example, if you
looked up an exercise

305
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,210
or if you looked up an occupation,

306
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,500
if you looked up a movement,

307
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,040
if you looked up an injury
example, then you do need to

308
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,369
cite and reference where you
got that information from.

309
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,970
And obviously, it's important to look

310
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,240
up credible resources, credible ones.

311
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,140
That means the textbooks
that we recommend.

312
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,100
So clinically oriented anatomy.

313
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:32,880
I hope everybody has that
reference in their assignment,

314
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,190
because that's the main reference
that we use in this unit.

315
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,770
So everybody should have
clinically oriented

316
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,900
anatomy and their reference
list, everybody.

317
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,320
And then there the other
ones that are really good,

318
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,430
like Color Atlas Anatomy, that
uses just cadaveric images.

319
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:53,330
There's also the online resources
that we provide, like anada media.

320
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,930
I anatomy anatomy viewer, all those are

321
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,550
provided there on your blackboard.

322
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,731
So use them.

323
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,070
And if you find anything else, you know,

324
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,210
there are some websites that
are pretty good for exercises.

325
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,910
I look up physical pedia all the time.

326
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,990
Physio, your PDA is good radio
area is very good for anatomy.

327
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,640
It has some radiological
structures there as well.

328
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,859
So if you want to compare
x rays and more eyes,

329
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,740
those are pretty that's
a pretty good website.

330
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,840
Not that it's necessary,
but it's it's a good website

331
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,359
to learn anatomy and applied
in the different way.

332
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,470
And injuries.

333
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,530
Ortho bullets.

334
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,140
Ortho Bullets is a great website as well.

335
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,310
Also, bullet has a lot of
musculoskeletal injuries,

336
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,470
examples and treatments, diagnoses.

337
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,250
So a lot of extra
information that we don't

338
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,109
necessarily cover in function anatomy.

339
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,900
But if it interests you, you know,

340
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,650
you can get a lot of
information there as well.

341
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:00,039
And I'm not really like I feel
that I can hug in Khan Academy,

342
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,570
they are secondary sources, very
much like most of my material.

343
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,400
The material that we upload and function

344
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,730
anatomy is very much a secondary source.

345
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,609
And as you may be aware, secondary sources

346
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,320
shouldn't really be referenced.

347
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,840
You shouldn't really reference them.

348
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,980
But obviously, we are all working
on evidence based information.

349
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,060
OK.

350
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,340
So just make sure that if you
are using our lecture slides,

351
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,920
Khan Academy or Ken Hubb,

352
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,010
then at least have a look and see
where they got that information

353
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,503
from and then reference
the primary source.

354
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:39,320
OK.

355
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,880
It's very important, again, to
reference a primary source,

356
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,330
and that's just for
general academic writing.

357
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,210
Primary sources are the ones
that you have to reference

358
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,310
unless you can't find the primary source.

359
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,150
Then you cite in reference
the secondary source.

360
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,640
So just be aware that it's not acceptable.

361
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,720
To reference the lecture
slides, it's not acceptable.

362
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,650
Because, as I said, the primary
source that we mainly use.

363
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,890
Are more clinically oriented anatomy.

364
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,650
And that's the one that
needs to be referenced.

365
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:15,300
OK.

366
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,609
Hopefully, that was clear.

367
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,550
I think that some questions came through.

368
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,060
So I'm sorry if I'm not keeping up.

369
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,430
And I have one, if we use slide
format, can we put in tech citations

370
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,010
and just like footer instead of
putting right beside the text?

371
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,978
That's a good question camera,
and I'm going to say.

372
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,130
It depends what you're citing.

373
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,570
It depends what you're citing.

374
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,080
If you're if you copy
like if you're citing

375
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,369
information and written information,

376
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,990
then that's OK to put it on the footer or,

377
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,989
you know, preferably nearby
the information where where you're at,

378
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,480
because that's the whole
point of sighting.

379
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,820
It's just to show where that
information comes from.

380
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,660
So as long as it's nearby that
information, and that's fine.

381
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,080
If it's really far away,
then that's not really OK,

382
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,060
because then I won't know where
you got that information

383
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,050
from and images you need to
site it under the images.

384
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,550
Like if you're if you
copy and paste an image,

385
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,210
then you need to put
the references right below the image.

386
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,720
It's pretty much the whole entire
reference below each image

387
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,350
that you copy and paste
if you don't reference images.

388
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,400
That's plagiarism.

389
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,190
OK, that said, that's
a copyright infringement.

390
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,619
All those images are copy written.

391
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,390
Even the ones you find on the Internet.

392
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,140
So, again, if you copy and paste
and you do not alter that image at all,

393
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,890
then you need to site it under each image

394
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:56,380
and then reference it
in the reference list.

395
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,629
OK.

396
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,420
All right, good stuff.

397
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,502
Let's just see here for the next
rubric is just a little bit different,

398
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,400
as you can see, this is for the video.

399
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,330
And in the video, we're
going to be looking

400
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,980
at a slightly different things.

401
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,380
For example, we're going
to be seeing, obviously,

402
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,540
the content, the concepts that we learned.

403
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,539
So, for example, description of
exercises or occupations, you know,

404
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,810
the joints and muscles that
are involved in a movement.

405
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,080
What type of contraction
they're performing.

406
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,109
If you include surface anatomy to
indicate where those structures

407
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:43,780
are and that you're able to do
the movement analysis effectively,

408
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,460
you know, that's really good
because it really synthesizes

409
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,710
all the information that we've
been learning in this unit.

410
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,260
So that's where we would
like to see in the video.

411
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,290
But obviously, you've
got to make sure that

412
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,850
all this information is integrated.

413
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:01,847
You are looking at all the main topics
lower limb, a prelim and trunk,

414
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,310
and that your communication
is clear and engaging.

415
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,590
And obviously, it is a video.

416
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,500
So digital competence
is going to be looked

417
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,580
at if you're able to film something.

418
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,650
There may be some editing
involved, though.

419
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,369
I understand we are not
Hollywood producers and we

420
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:26,119
shouldn't spend too much
time perfecting this.

421
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,859
So just create a video that contains all

422
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,140
this information and that's organized.

423
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,609
And that's what we're
going to be looking at.

424
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:38,180
Doesn't need to have all the flares in all

425
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,940
the days and hours of work behind it.

426
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,933
OK, and obviously you're going
to be in both assignments

427
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,950
and both not both assigned
to both components,

428
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,130
you're going to be measured
on a scale from one to five.

429
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,390
Obviously, it's a zero.

430
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,820
If you don't submit anything
by if you submit something,

431
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,980
then it's going to be on a one to five.

432
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,910
And I only put down
the description here of the fives,

433
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,650
because that's what I would
like everybody to aim for.

434
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,930
You know, you want to
demonstrate in depth,

435
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,109
accurate information that's
clearly and logically

436
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,330
structure that's clear and engaging,

437
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,859
and that it has pretty
good audio visual quality

438
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,660
and it's in within the time limit.

439
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,570
OK, so if you can manage
to hit all these targets,

440
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,850
then that's it, then it should be fine.

441
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,570
Note that the written
component is worth 20 marks

442
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,600
and the video component is worth 20 marks.

443
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,119
So in total, this assignment is worth

444
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,780
40 percent of your marks, 40 percent.

445
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,810
So this is the most heavily
weighted assignment that you have.

446
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,600
So when that you have
the most time to work on.

447
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,740
And it's the one that as well as
long as you follow, if you you know,

448
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,050
if you're coming to classes,
if you're keeping up with the content,

449
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,080
and if you are checking
the rubrics of what you include,

450
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,950
then you should do really
well and it really well.

451
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,920
And I just want to give
you all a few examples

452
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,380
of what we had submitted previously.

453
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:19,533
I do add at the end of each module,
examples of previous assignments,

454
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,470
examples of really good
previous assignments.

455
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,840
Obviously, cherry picked
the ones that are the best for you.

456
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,530
And I just want to show you the format.

457
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,070
So let's just start here on
this left hand side where

458
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,730
you can see some flash
cards and flash cards or,

459
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,380
you know, great ways to learn.

460
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,690
If you create your own flash cards

461
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,540
and you add all the necessary information,

462
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,880
speak to the functions and actions.

463
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,500
And as you can see here on these
flash cards, the student,

464
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,534
she took a very generic phone
image just off the Internet.

465
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,760
But then she drew over it.

466
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,900
So she actually created something.

467
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,730
She modified this image.

468
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,970
So since she modified this
image, so what she did,

469
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,880
she doesn't need to reference it
because it's her own creation.

470
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,920
So there was no need to
reference all of this.

471
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,840
But unless at the very end, at
the very end, create a reference list.

472
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,000
And obviously, I think
that the information was

473
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,700
taken from more clinically
oriented anatomy.

474
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,520
Another good example are
fold-out fold-out cier.

475
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,666
For example, the student drew
a skeleton in a big cardboard

476
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,880
cardboard bow on those
hard pieces of paper.

477
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,290
And then she drew
the muscles on colored papers,

478
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,450
cut them out in their shape
and layered them over the skeleton.

479
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,060
So this shows a really good understanding

480
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,170
of attachments, shapes, layering.

481
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,729
This is really good.

482
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,830
And behind each of these muscles,
you would fold out and there

483
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,410
would be the information
behind each of these muscles,

484
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,420
the attachments,
the actions, the nerve supply.

485
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:17,340
And at the end, she also
included some exercise examples.

486
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,090
Another good example was a workout guide,

487
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,880
the student had a gym in his backyard,

488
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,090
so he pictured himself doing exercises.

489
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,340
He highlighted the muscles that were being

490
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,380
targeted in each one of these exercises.

491
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,920
And then he created tables to add more

492
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,869
information to show his understanding.

493
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,260
What is an open chain kinetic exercise?

494
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,430
Common mistakes?

495
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,740
What are the agonists or
the prime movers of the exercise?

496
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,270
So you can see here that he went
beyond what was being asked of him.

497
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,940
Not only did he talk about
the main characteristics,

498
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,510
but he also analyzed them
in in a very useful way,

499
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,560
in a very functional way.

500
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,310
And the next example that
I'm going to give you is

501
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,740
probably the one that
students prefer the most.

502
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,619
And that's creating a notebook.

503
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,330
OK, so a notebook is a really
good way to learn, obviously,

504
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,090
and it's absolutely
encouraged and accepted.

505
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,060
This one here is a notebook,

506
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,024
but it was created as
an electronic notebook.

507
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,619
And he drew this.

508
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,390
He drew this interior thigh
region in the muscles,

509
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,520
added all the information next to it,

510
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,340
even added the picture of
a muscle of a muscle here.

511
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,180
That's very we don't mention it
much to the articulators journal.

512
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,010
At the end, he included
exercises to show how these

513
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,620
muscles would be engaged
in these exercises.

514
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,380
Note that he didn't.

515
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,250
Do an exercise for each individual muscle.

516
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,520
You know, because that's not how
muscles work, muscles work as groups.

517
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,520
So you don't have to give an example
for each individual muscle.

518
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,260
But usually as a group.

519
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,170
So one example for a group.

520
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,510
Yeah, that's highly recommended
because it's showing

521
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,370
us that you understand how
to apply this knowledge.

522
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,720
So showing us an exercises, showing it.

523
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,840
I had a student last year
who was a yoga instructor

524
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,869
and she analyzed yoga
postures, looked excellent.

525
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:22,080
Excellent.

526
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,190
I should upload her assignment as well.

527
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,210
And she also analyzed
lengthening exercises,

528
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,830
not just strengthening, but lengthening.

529
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,900
So that was really good.

530
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,380
And again, that's why I'm
giving you a few options.

531
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,636
It's not supposed to be one
just in one very specific way.

532
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,500
It can be the way that
you think that you're

533
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,060
going to enjoy creating the most.

534
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,700
And it's going to be more
useful for you in the future.

535
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:50,900
OK.

536
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,760
Obviously, pump cars are
quicker and easier.

537
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,314
The fold-out.

538
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,340
It's for somebody who likes to
do the arts and crafts side.

539
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,090
This student really likes
exercising in this student here.

540
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,028
I think just.

541
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,340
Good package here as well, right?

542
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,040
Good, good.

543
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,190
Good points in the artsy side and and,

544
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,800
you know, in just kind of integrated,

545
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,520
I think that the integrated
the information here very well.

546
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,080
That was the main thing that
we were very impressed with.

547
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,880
It was with the integration.

548
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,730
Now, I want to just separate
one thing from another,

549
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,400
and that is when we say that
you should be creative.

550
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,960
We don't mean artsy.

551
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,340
We don't mean that you
need to be a Picasso, OK?

552
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,610
You don't have to be artsy.

553
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,850
Create art.

554
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,240
Being creative means that
you are creating something,

555
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,610
that you are generating the images,

556
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,030
you are drawing them, you
are taking pictures,

557
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,370
you're drawing it on your skin.

558
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,060
I have some students who have done
like surface anatomy assignments,

559
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,240
and they drew on their
skin or they took pictures

560
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,280
of themselves and then drew on the images.

561
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,800
And, you know, so there they
created this information.

562
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,380
They didn't copy
and paste it from elsewhere.

563
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,440
Copy and pasting obviously
is not going to get as many

564
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,290
marks because it's just not
something that you create.

565
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,650
And if you don't create
the process, you'll learn less.

566
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,230
So that's just how it's measured.

567
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,390
If you create something, you're
going to be marked higher.

568
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,950
Do you copy and paste?

569
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,981
It's going to be lower.

570
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:23,050
OK.

571
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,700
Just keep that in mind.

572
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,960
All right.

573
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,410
And I should change this, actually.

574
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,690
I'm sorry, this is incorrect here.

575
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,640
The the due dates are correct.

576
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,160
They're both due in week
thirteen at the last day.

577
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,940
So Friday week 13 for the video
you're going to uploaded

578
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,870
on to YouTube and you're
going to create a link.

579
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,200
OK, you're going to create a link
and then you're going to submit it.

580
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,730
So you're not going to
send it to this email.

581
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,620
You're actually going to
submit it on Blackbaud.

582
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,540
There's going to be
a blackboard submission point.

583
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,910
OK, so we created this recently.

584
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,290
We recently found out how to do it.

585
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,690
That's why I forgot to change this.

586
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,930
But there's going to be
a blackboard submission points,

587
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,810
and that's where you're going
to submit the link to.

588
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,660
I do want to highlight that, you know,

589
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,180
you give yourself some time to create

590
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,860
the video and upload it on YouTube
depending on the size of the video.

591
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,220
It can take hours to
upload a link to YouTube.

592
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,680
So that means you definitely
shouldn't be doing this.

593
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,890
30 minutes before the assignment is due,

594
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,530
because it's going to be late
if if you try to do that.

595
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,640
If you notice on your program calendar,

596
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,760
you actually have you actually will finish

597
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,740
pretty much all your topics in week 10.

598
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,470
Week 10 is the last time
that we have new content.

599
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,250
So that means everybody can finish
their written assignment by week 10.

600
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,249
Everybody, including those who have
shrunk as their as their topic.

601
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,230
So if you completed a week 10,

602
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,280
then you have weeks 11
and 12 to work on the video.

603
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,450
And hopefully you do meet with with
your group in weeks 11 and 12,

604
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,700
because that's when you
should be creating the video.

605
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,530
It's going to take time.

606
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,330
OK, so give yourselves that time.

607
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,530
And once you do create the video,

608
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,450
you're going to uploaded to YouTube again,

609
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,880
takes a few hours of
a few minutes or a few

610
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,560
hours to upload it and create the link.

611
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,078
You can create a private link
so that not everybody has access to it.

612
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,910
OK, so if you don't want it to be
out there for everybody to see.

613
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,290
Create a private link and then upload it

614
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,700
through the Blackwatch submission point.

615
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,730
Same here with the written assignment.

616
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,740
You're going to it's going to be
due on the same time and again,

617
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,660
don't leave it at
the last minute to submit it,

618
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,000
because there's always
something that happens

619
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,640
with Turnitin that you just don't expect.

620
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:58,115
So, for example, you shoot something like

621
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,970
an assignment that cannot
be scanned for words.

622
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,630
It's not going to be
accepted for through turned

623
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,400
it in because turn it in scanned words.

624
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,820
So usually if you're going to
take pictures of your assignment,

625
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,070
then that means that you at
least have to have a cover

626
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,710
page with words on them
in at least 20 words.

627
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,469
So that means that you need
to create a word file,

628
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,110
combine it with the pictures,
and then submit it like that.

629
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,670
So it's recognized by Turnitin.

630
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,280
And if you try to keep submitting it,

631
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,680
it's going to get you error is
not going to let you submitted.

632
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,290
Another thing that it
doesn't let you submit,

633
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,270
if it's the file is too big,

634
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,280
if it's over a hundred,
I think it's over a hundred.

635
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,780
Let me just double check here.

636
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,969
I didn't put it up.

637
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,297
It's in your.

638
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,120
Yeah, it's definitely in
your assessment too folder.

639
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,891
I think it's over 100 megabytes.

640
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:53,330
Turn it in.

641
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,364
Doesn't accept it.

642
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,920
So you got to make sure that your
assignment is also under a hundred

643
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,500
megabytes so that you can
submit it on to turn it in.

644
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,219
So there are few things that you
need to troubleshoot sometimes,

645
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,700
and you don't want to do that half
an hour before the assignment is due.

646
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,327
Or else it's going to be like.

647
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,800
And as I said, the muscle assignment.

648
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,780
You can finish it by week 12.

649
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,410
Everybody can finish it so everybody
can finish it by week 10.

650
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,730
So we're going to open
the submission point in week 10,

651
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,060
and we hope that students
start submitting it by then.

652
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:28,140
OK.

653
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,930
You shouldn't be waiting
until the last week,

654
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,180
the very last day to
submit your assignment,

655
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,600
because remember that you have other
assignments to do on the same week.

656
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,660
And if you think that you're going to

657
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,040
submit everything at the same time,

658
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,090
it's just not going to happen.

659
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:46,650
So give yourself enough time to
submit both of these components.

660
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,410
Because if you don't, then late penalties
do apply if it's a few minutes

661
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:58,496
after use of the do time
and date, then it's five percent.

662
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:04,359
Then if it's over 24 hours,
then it's 15 percent.

663
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,830
And then from then onwards,
it's like 10 percent.

664
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,090
And after five days and you
just don't get anything.

665
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:13,130
So just make sure they use them.

666
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,156
Submit an all time.

667
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,400
And I guess we're the last
things is you have to be mindful

668
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,360
of plagiarism by not copy
and paste indirect information,

669
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,570
by having a reference list
and referencing the images that you use.

670
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,560
And, you know, just make sure
that you submit a PDF file,

671
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,880
turn it in, and it's something
that can scan words.

672
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,330
OK, because it needs to
be able to scan words.

673
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,969
It can't just be images.

674
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,700
So at least create a Covid
page with your name.

675
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,300
The title of the assignment,
the name of the unit,

676
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,110
your student I.D., you
know all that information.

677
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,353
Your topic.

678
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,270
So your topic is going
to be one of these ones.

679
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,340
Each member of the group will
choose one of these topics trunk,

680
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,050
upper limb or lower limb.

681
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,560
And these groups of three
or four people, you know,

682
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,580
if there's three people, each
one will choose each topic.

683
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,400
And if there's four people,

684
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:18,340
then two people in the group will
be able to do the same topic.

685
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,610
But individual assignments, it's not that

686
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,070
they can work on the same assignment.

687
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,190
They're still going to be doing individual

688
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,050
assignments on the same topic.

689
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,957
That's it.

690
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,700
Everybody must do a different topic,

691
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,360
because remember that the video is
about combining all these topics.

692
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,980
If there is a member in your
group that does not collaborate,

693
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,560
that doesn't answer emails,

694
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,680
and that just doesn't show
up to film the video.

695
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,049
Please let me know.

696
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,200
Please email me saying
the day we filmed it,

697
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,620
this person did not show up because they

698
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,300
can't get grades if they don't show up.

699
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,290
And if they don't do their part
because they have to do their part,

700
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,120
that means if they have the trunk,

701
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,330
they have to show they
have to contribute to that

702
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,060
video component and analyzing the truck.

703
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,080
So everybody has to engage in this video.

704
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,650
You can't just leave it to
your peers to create a video.

705
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,630
That's why everybody needs
to have a different topic.

706
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,950
And if the student doesn't
show up, it's not going to.

707
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,739
It's not going to harm
the others in your group,

708
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:33,880
because essentially I'm going to be
looking at you all as individuals.

709
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,580
OK, because everybody has an individual

710
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,190
part in both of these components.

711
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,300
So don't be worried if somebody
doesn't show up in your group,

712
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,460
you know, try to contact them, obviously.

713
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,400
But if they just don't
collaborate, don't worry,

714
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,239
you're not going to be disadvantaged.

715
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,060
But you do need to tell
me what's happening.

716
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,989
Let me just say a few questions
that I got just recently,

717
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,830
so when it says most of the lower limbs.

718
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,601
Is it all muscles like quads,
hamstrings, foot gastrocnemius?

719
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:08,890
So, Sean.

720
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,850
Yeah, pretty much it.

721
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,310
So everything that's in each module,

722
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,590
pretty much if you think
about them as modules,

723
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,350
everything that is in
module one is a lower limb.

724
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,980
Everything that's module
two is upper limb.

725
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,710
Everything that's module three is trunk.

726
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,630
So if you think about lower limb,
you started in the pelvic region.

727
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,078
That's iliac muscles, gluteal
muscles, medial thigh muscles.

728
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,330
Anterior thigh, posterior
thigh, posterior leg,

729
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,120
anterior leg, lateral
leg and intrinsic foot.

730
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,960
So all of those would be included in
the lower limb muscle assignment.

731
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:54,390
And let's see, I have another.

732
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,760
If there's a cap.

733
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,960
Upload the muscle resource.

734
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,330
Yeah, so that's it.

735
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,290
So if you have a cap, you will have

736
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,930
the same turn it in submission points.

737
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,260
So you you know, everybody has their
own identifier and turn it in.

738
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,830
And those who have caps,
we have them already

739
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,739
indicated on Blackboard
that you will not be

740
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:19,697
penalized if you submitted
a few days after the due date,

741
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,630
but only the written component.

742
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,090
OK, so the written component is the one

743
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,450
that you do have an extension for.

744
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:31,980
But everybody needs to submit the video at

745
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,350
the same time because
it's a group assignment.

746
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,310
And I have quite a few questions.

747
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,290
Let me just go through it.

748
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,150
Maximum pages is counted
per person or as a group.

749
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,640
OK, so 30 pages per person.

750
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,160
So per topic.

751
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,450
So you add your own individual topic,

752
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,130
you have 30 pages maximum, no lower limit.

753
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,870
So I can definitely be shorter than that.

754
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,310
To do we have to include all
the muscles of the upper limbs

755
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,380
or can we select the ones
we like to make notes for?

756
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:14,425
Well, all the ones that are in
the module to start its module, too.

757
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,760
So it is pretty much all
the ones that we covered.

758
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,304
OK.

759
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,230
You just have to at least mention them.

760
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,210
You can't focus on the prime movers.

761
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:25,251
Absolutely.

762
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,160
But you do need to mention them,

763
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,910
especially if we if I've
presented their attachments.

764
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:36,134
So, for example, if you noticed in
the lower limbs we went through,

765
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,300
the attachments have pretty
much all the muscles

766
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,969
except for the intrinsic foot muscles,

767
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,400
because we don't really need to understand

768
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,719
how they function individually.

769
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,810
And it's very similar with the upper limb.

770
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,940
Yes, it is important to
know the attachments

771
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,650
of most of the upper limb muscles.

772
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,060
But we do not go into too many details
on the intrinsic hand muscles.

773
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,540
So like we have intrinsic foot muscles,
we have intrinsic hand muscles.

774
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:04,480
So, again, we don't really
need the attachments

775
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
for the intrinsic muscles.

776
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,030
So I would say it that way,
and with the trunk, it's very similar.

777
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,880
There are many muscles that are part

778
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,980
of the intrinsic back muscle region.

779
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,810
But the deepest layer, we don't really.

780
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,120
We don't really focus too much
on the attachments because

781
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,050
there's such small muscles
around joints that they

782
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,080
stare stabilizers and we don't
really need to understand

783
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,940
their attachments to
understand their function.

784
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,980
And then number three, a few weeks ago,

785
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,110
I received an email on a deferred exam.

786
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,219
I wonder if.

787
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,450
I wonder if it is for those
who have requested the friend

788
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,750
exam or if it's for everyone
who is taking the course.

789
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,809
OK.

790
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:53,330
No, it's just for those
who deferred the exam.

791
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,440
So you know that we had the mid
semester lab exam Monday and Tuesday

792
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:02,120
and students who were sick or who
had to defer for any reason.

793
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,730
Those were the ones who
had to defer the exam.

794
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,150
And so they went through
the online application

795
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,310
process and it was just informing

796
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,870
them when the deferred dates are
the deferred dates are in December.

797
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,410
I've already confirmed
the dates on the 6th of September.

798
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,427
Of December.

799
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:22,630
Yeah, because that's when we
can run the lab exams again,

800
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,739
as you may understand.

801
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,878
We can set up Alembic in tuition
free week or during classes.

802
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,910
We just don't have
the time or space for that.

803
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,780
So all the deferred exams
happen in December.

804
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,050
But if you completed your
exam on Monday or Tuesday,

805
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:40,120
you're done with it.

806
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,610
That's it.

807
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,100
That's it.

808
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,410
You don't have to do anything else.

809
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,500
All right, good questions.

810
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,530
And I guess just to finish here with this

811
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,290
muscle resource in your tutorials,

812
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,140
what you were asked to do was
to form groups of three.

813
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,456
Everybody needed to choose
a topic so that the three or four

814
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,600
people in your group had to
choose a different topic.

815
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,650
And then you had to email
HMV one zero zero two

816
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,650
with the following subject
assessment to group.

817
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:14,630
And it had to have your group members

818
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,719
and the topics that
each one of them chose.

819
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,680
And a quick video idea.

820
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,610
Just say we chose Adonal.

821
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,460
We chose plucking the eyebrows.

822
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,910
You know, that was the video
idea, which is completely fine.

823
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,470
So if you had your tutorials, this
is what you should have done by now.

824
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,170
OK.

825
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,800
All the groups will be formed
by tomorrow afternoon.

826
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:45,162
So please send it to this email
so that we can create it and.

827
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,450
If you did not go to your tutorial,

828
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,600
first of all, bad, you should have gone.

829
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,870
It was required for all students to go.

830
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,550
The students who emailed me with
justifications, I said, great.

831
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,420
We have a solution for you.

832
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,350
We have a group for you.

833
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,376
That's fine.

834
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,070
But those of you who did
not go did not justify

835
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,690
why we didn't come to the tutorial.

836
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,040
We're just going to put you in
random groups of three people,

837
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,570
three or four people, and it'll
be up to you to organize that,

838
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,480
organize when to meet
what topics each one of

839
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,630
you will have to submit
and what video idea.

840
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,110
So there's not going to be
an opportunity to do this in class again,

841
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,620
because this was this was
the opportunity to do it.

842
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,920
So I don't really want to hear complaints.

843
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,560
If you don't like your
group or if you feel

844
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,210
like you don't want to do that topic,

845
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,100
you're just going to
have to sort itself out.

846
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:49,710
If you didn't have your tutorial
yet, go go to the tutorial,

847
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,130
because then you will have
an idea which topic to do.

848
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,340
And you will have had
the opportunity to discuss an idea,

849
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,600
see your peers or see your group
members and maybe discuss when

850
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,850
it will be a good time to film
the video in week 11 or week 12.

851
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,870
So what are the groups chosen
randomly, can we decide?

852
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,340
Yes, Sean, that's it.

853
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,800
So for those of you who have
not had your tutorial yet,

854
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,870
you will be able to choose your groups.

855
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,730
So within your tutorial group,

856
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:28,071
if you already work with two
or three people on a normal basis,

857
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,980
then you can talk to them
and then form the group.

858
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:36,500
OK, so if you haven't had your
tutorial yet, go form your groups.

859
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,370
Email HMV one zero zero
two with the topics

860
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,680
that each one of you
chose in a video idea,

861
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,040
because and then you can also
discuss with your tutors.

862
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,749
What?

863
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,670
Any questions that you may have or ask
them for any feedback resistance?

864
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,870
So, yeah, go to your tutorials.

865
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:02,840
And that's why I said everybody is
is like everybody is obligated to

866
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,489
go to your tutorial this week because
it's part of your assignment.

867
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,640
It's part of your assessment.

868
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,250
It's worth 40 percent of your marks.

869
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:15,989
So those who did not show up to their
tutorials this week, I'm just.

870
00:47:16,913 --> 00:47:17,930
I don't even know how.

871
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,650
I'm speechless, really, that they didn't

872
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,300
go to class and then justify it.

873
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,420
OK.

874
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,210
All right, but obviously you
are all doing very well.

875
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,192
He showed up to this collaborates
session, asked great questions.

876
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,380
That's really all I had to do.

877
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,620
So I'm just going to stay here for another

878
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,390
few minutes answering questions.

879
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,620
So I got a question here from Cameron
saying for movement analysis,

880
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,040
how many movements do we
need to break down to?

881
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,570
We analyze the movements of one big
occupation or do we focus on two

882
00:47:55,570 --> 00:48:00,010
or three smaller tasks that are
part of the bigger occupation?

883
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,750
Excellent question.

884
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,777
Camera.

885
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,644
You know, don't don't try
to do too much, obviously.

886
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,170
So if you're thinking about
an example of somebody

887
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,640
stacking a can in a supermarket shelf.

888
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:21,190
So what I would be analyzing
is that reaching movement

889
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,330
and maybe the return
movement if there is time.

890
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:30,040
KING because you're going to have to
analyze everything in that reaching

891
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,580
movement and that could be starting
all the way from the foot.

892
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,570
So, for example, your.

893
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,010
Talo Kraj Lindt will need
to go into planter flexion

894
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,200
using the gastrocnemius and slowly as or

895
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,989
tricep souri muscles
contracting concentrically

896
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,900
in these movements happen in the frontal.

897
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,930
So in these moves happen in the sagittal

898
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,520
plane around the coronal axis.

899
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,670
So this see that you're going
to do it on the ankle and then

900
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,980
you're going to analyze
what's happening on the need.

901
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,020
The knee is an extension.

902
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,040
So is the hip.

903
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,070
The trunk is stabilizing.

904
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,053
The vertebral column and the shoulder
joint is going into flexion.

905
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,770
Your elbow is extending your muscles.

906
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,760
So your interior form muscles
are grabbing that can

907
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,280
and then you're flexing
to put it on the shelf.

908
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,610
So do you see how I went
through pretty much from

909
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,420
the lower limb to
the all the way to placing

910
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:37,480
the shelf down and analyzing
this movement according to,

911
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,910
you know, the joints, muscles?

912
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,210
The obvious, I didn't do it completely.

913
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,560
I skipped a few steps here.

914
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,350
The one I did the most was the ankle one.

915
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:49,780
But you would be analyzing all the way up.

916
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,330
So obviously, you're going to be
focusing on the main movements.

917
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,650
The main movements here would be plenty of

918
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,360
flexion infliction of the shoulder girdle

919
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,050
region or flexion of
the Gleno Humera joint

920
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,310
in this capital, thoracic joints.

921
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,920
OK, so those are the ones that
are going to be analyzing.

922
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:08,770
And if there's time to do
the return movement, then great.

923
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:14,851
But definitely not explaining
how to entirely play football.

924
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,989
You know, that's just
going to be way too much

925
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:19,969
and definitely doesn't
fit in five minutes.

926
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,969
So choose one movement.

927
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,580
Of one occupation or sports or physical

928
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,640
activity or movement and focus on that.

929
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,723
Got it.

930
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,899
Excellent.

931
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,910
And it could be big task,
could be a little task.

932
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,430
I use the idea of plucking your eyebrows.

933
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,200
That's still OK.

934
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,390
You know, what you're going
to do here is going to

935
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:48,260
analyze is the person
in sitting or standing,

936
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,380
where are the joints in space,
which movements are happening?

937
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,290
And if there's a movement happening,
are these movements happening?

938
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:58,860
Which Cardinal Plains of movement
around which plant, in which plane,

939
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,080
around which axis, in which
muscles are engaged in,

940
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,130
how are they contracting?

941
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,520
So if you're pulling together
all this information,

942
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,969
then, hey, that's a good video.

943
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,030
That's a good explanation.

944
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,860
Does anybody else have
any further questions?

945
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,480
I must say that I'm very impressed with

946
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,310
the quality of the questions here.

947
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,955
I think then.

948
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:29,370
We covered pretty much everything.

949
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,350
The questions help me remember
some important details,

950
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,969
important aspects of the assignment.

951
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,020
I really hope this session
helped you understand

952
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,520
your assignment a bit better.

953
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,580
And we have one more question.

954
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,850
So we've chosen a mother
with lower back pain

955
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:53,250
to hold a baby for
prolonged period of time.

956
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,661
Can we choose standing only
with no movement as well?

957
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,719
You can.

958
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:01,768
You can.

959
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:07,084
But I would say there is there
is still things happening.

960
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:15,600
And by things, I mean, your joints
are still in a certain position.

961
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,567
So describe those positions, describe
how the joints are positioned.

962
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:24,239
So in which Kardinal
plane around which axis,

963
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,700
and think about how
the muscles are working

964
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,010
when the mother is holding the baby.

965
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,980
Because there's a lot of
isometric contraction

966
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,960
happening here in this in this activity.

967
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,000
And then you can also
think around, you know,

968
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,160
a mother probably doesn't
just stand holding the baby.

969
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,190
The mother probably stands
bouncing the baby up and down.

970
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,620
So think about right.

971
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,750
So how is this bouncy movement
like what's actually happening?

972
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:53,702
Which muscles are contributing
to this movement or to this?

973
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,630
It ends up being an occupation that led

974
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,430
to this occupation of holding the baby.

975
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,900
So I guess, yes, you absolutely can.

976
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,450
As I said, not all of
the joints need to be moving

977
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,090
at the same time to do
the movement analysis.

978
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,940
Just describe what's
happening in these joints

979
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,380
and how these muscles are working.

980
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,850
OK, good stuff.

981
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,920
Let's see volleyball spike to contribute

982
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,660
to all the muscles for the video.

983
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:31,880
Absolutely, yeah, volleyball
spike is excellent.

984
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,950
So I guess then it
depends on where you're.

985
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,719
Starting from I would assume that you
would be starting from, you know,

986
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,880
jumping up, so you would start
actually from the very.

987
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:50,110
From the ankle joint region
and moving up to what's

988
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,910
happening in the new what's
happening in the hip,

989
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,500
what's happening in the vertebral column,

990
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,360
and ultimately, you know,
the arm that has gone up into

991
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:02,500
flexion and is going to
extension during a spike.

992
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,390
So, yeah, that's a that's a very
awesome movement channelize.

993
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,780
I like the creativity,
everyone, this is a very good.

994
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:20,110
All right, sounds really good, everyone.

995
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,469
I'll probably just stay for another five

996
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,330
minutes in case you have any questions.

997
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,360
If you don't have any other questions,

998
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,450
then I think this is pretty much it.

999
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,770
I'd like to thank you all for
hanging in there and asking

1000
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,440
such great questions and good
luck on your assignment.

1001
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,900
You know, like I don't
mind having a look at the.

1002
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,110
Neither do your tutors, like
bringing your assignment

1003
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,000
into class so they could
have a quick look.

1004
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,060
And quick feedback, like quick
feedback is considerable.

1005
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,469
We can't spend 30 minutes on each
assignment giving you feedback.

1006
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:58,170
But if I could just have a quick
look and say, oh, this looks good,

1007
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,989
or, hey, how about you add
more information on this?

1008
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,870
You know, this could give
you some good pointers.

1009
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,770
So if you start your assignment short,

1010
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,590
your tutor and the tutor could give
you a few pointers along the way.

1011
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,290
Then it's less of a surprise at the end

1012
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,739
when you submit it and get your grades.

1013
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:16,822
All right, thank you.

1014
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,880
Brian, I'm going to well.

1015
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,820
This link will stay on collaborate.

1016
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,580
So if you click on collaborate, you know,

1017
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,500
this recording will stay there.

1018
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:31,020
As long as it's a recent recording,
it'll stay there, if it's not there,

1019
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,040
that means you just have to go
back to a different time window,

1020
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,300
but it'll stay there for a few weeks.

1021
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,940
I'm also going to copy
the link and send it out as

1022
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,700
an announcement so that
the students who couldn't

1023
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,520
make it today could watch
it and be very clear

1024
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,290
where to click on to watch the video.

1025
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,130
Yes, in the video assignment,
so I'm going to sneeze.

1026
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,340
So sorry about that.

1027
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,390
Yes, the video component is five minutes.

1028
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:07,239
And you can go over 30 seconds under
30 seconds, that's completely fine.

1029
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,930
Just not too much over those times.

1030
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,140
Yeah, because if it starts to get
closer to 6:00 or close to four,

1031
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,130
then that's really not the time limit.

1032
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,120
You're going to get some marks taken out

1033
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,610
if you do long videos
or short or too short.

1034
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,239
See what muscles trunk
and back, move the scapula,

1035
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,770
or would that be the upper limb?

1036
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:32,170
Yeah, so good question, Sean.

1037
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,440
I know that they look like
that's Kapoor's on the back,

1038
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,030
but it's more involved
with the upper limbs.

1039
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,380
So all those xou up into killer muscles,

1040
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,150
they are part of the upper limb.

1041
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:47,750
If your topic is the trunk,
then that means then

1042
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,440
you're going to be looking at the back,

1043
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,330
the intrinsic back muscles as well.

1044
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,989
And that starts with.

1045
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,630
Your neck muscles,
so that would be, you know,

1046
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,120
your spleen is Kaputa spleen services,

1047
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,300
followed by the erectors spiny muscles.

1048
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,810
Then you have the deep
and minor deep layers.

1049
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,080
And let's not forget that you
would also have the respiratory

1050
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,030
muscles and the abdominal
muscles for trunk.

1051
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:18,540
So it's everything that's in
the axial skeleton region.

1052
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,770
But the muscles that move
the scapula, that upper limb.

1053
00:57:30,361 --> 00:57:31,410
And no problem.

1054
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:32,180
Good questions.
